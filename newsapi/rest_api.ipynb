A recent Gartner study found that GenAI solutions are the number one AI solution used by organizations, with most companies leveraging GenAI features built into existing tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot. In my experience, most businesses are looking for some sort of \"private ChatGPT\" they can use to get more value from their unique organizational data. Company goals vary from finding information in particular documents, generating reports based on tabular data, and summarizing content, to finding all the projects related to some domain, and much more.\\n\\nThis article explores various approaches to solve these problems, outlining the pros, cons, and applications of each. My goal is to provide guidance on when to consider different approaches and how to combine them for the best outcomes, covering everything from the most complex and expensive approaches like pre-training to the simplest, most cost-effective techniques like prompt engineering.\\n\\nThe sequence of the article is intended to build from the foundational concepts for model training (pre-training, continued pre-training, and fine tuning) to the more commonly understood techniques (RAG and prompt engineering) for interacting with existing models.\\n\\nThere is no one-size fits all approach to tackling GenAI problems. Most use cases require a combination of techniques to achieve successful outcomes. Typically, organizations start with a model like GPT-4, Llama3 70b Instruct, or DBRX Instruct which have been pretrained on trillions of tokens to perform next token prediction, then fine-tuned for a particular task, like instruction or chat. Instruction based models are trained and optimized to follow specific directions given in the prompt while chat based models are trained and optimized to handle conversational formats over multiple turns, maintaining context and coherence throughout the conversation.\\n\\nUsing existing models allows organizations to take advantage of the significant time and financial investments made by companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Databricks to curate datasets, create innovative architectures, and train and evaluate their models.\\n\\nAlthough not every company will need to pre-train or instruction fine-tune their models, anyone using a Large Language Model (LLM) benefits from the groundwork laid by these industry leaders. This foundation allows other companies to address their unique challenges without starting from scratch.\\n\\nIn the following sections, we\\'ll explore pre-training, fine-tuning (both instruction fine-tuning, and continued pre-training), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning embeddings for RAG, and prompt engineering, discussing how and when each of these approaches should be used or considered.\\n\\nOverview: Pre-Training a model creates a foundation which will be used as a base for all downstream tasks. This process includes defining the architecture for the model, curating a massive dataset (generally trillions of tokens), training the model, and evaluating its performance. In the context of LLMs and SLMs, the pre-training phase is used to inject knowledge into the model, enabling it to predict the next word or token in a sequence. For instance, in the sentence \"the cat sat on the ___\", the model learns to predict \"mat\".\\n\\nCompanies like OpenAI have invested heavily in the pre-training phase for their GPT models, but since models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o are closed source it is not possible to use the underlying architecture and pre-train the model on a different dataset with different parameters. However, with resources like Mosaic AI\\'s pre-training API it is possible to pre-train open source models like DBRX.\\n\\nApplications: Generally, pre-training your own model is only necessary if none of the other approaches are sufficient for your use case. For example, if you wanted to train a model to understand a new language it has no previous exposure to, you may consider pre-training it then fine-tuning it for your intended use.\\n\\nOnce the base training is complete, the models typically need to be fine-tuned so that they can perform tasks effectively. When you see a model labeled as a chat or instruct model, that indicates the base model has been fine-tuned for either of those purposes. Nearly any model you interact with today has been fine-tuned for one of these purposes so that end users can interact with the model efficiently.\\n\\nGiven the incredible cost and intensive process required to pre-train a model, most organizations decide to leverage existing models in their GenAI use cases. To get started with pretraining, check out Mosaic AI\\'s pretraining API, this allows you to pretrain a Databricks DBRX model with different parameter sizes.\\n\\nOverview: CPT is a type of fine-tuning that allows extends the knowledge of an existing model rather than training the entire model from scratch. The output of a model that\\'s gone through CPT will still predict the next token. In general it\\'s recommended that you use CPT then Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) this way you can extend the model\\'s knowledge first, then tune it to a particular task like following instructions or chat. If done in the reverse order, the model may forget instructions that it learned during the IFT phase.\\n\\nApplications: For industries with highly domain specific content like healthcare or legal, CPT may be a great option for introducing new topics to the model. With tools like Mosaic AI\\'s Fine-Tuning API you can easily get started with CPT, all you need is a series of text files you want to use for training. For the CPT process, all the text files will be concatenated with a separation token between each of the documents, Mosaic handles the complexity behind the scenes for how these files get fed to the model for training.\\n\\nAs an example, let\\'s say we used CPT with a series of text files about responsible AI and AI policies. If I prompt the model to \"Tell me three principles important to Responsible AI\", I would likely get a response with a high probability to follow the sentence I prompted like \"I need to understand the key Responsible AI principles so I can train an effective model\". Although this response is related to my prompt, it does not directly answer the question. This demonstrates the need for IFT to refine the models instruction following capabilities.\\n\\nOverview: IFT is used to teach a model how to perform a particular task. It typically requires thousands of examples and can be used for a specific purpose such as improving question answering, extracting key information, or adopting a certain tone.\\n\\nApplications: IFT helps the model perform particular tasks like question answering much better. Using the prompt \"Tell me three principles important to Responsible AI\", a model that had undergone IFT would likely respond with an answer to the question like \"Responsible AI is critical for ensuring the ethical use of models grounded in core principles like transparency, fairness, and privacy. Following responsible AI principles helps align the solution with broader societal values and ethical standards\". This response is more useful to the end user compared to a response that may come from a CPT or PT model only since it addresses the question directly.\\n\\nNote that there are a variety of fine-tuning approaches and techniques designed to improve the overall model performance and reduce both time and cost associated with training.\\n\\nOverview: RAG enables language models to answer questions using information outside of their training data. In the RAG process, a user query triggers a retrieval of relevant information from a vector index, which is then integrated into a new prompt along with the original query to generate a response. This technique is one of the most common techniques used today due to its effectiveness and simplicity.\\n\\nApplications: Any use case involving question and answering over a set of documents will typically involve RAG. It\\'s a very practical way to get started with Generative AI and requires no additional model training. The emerging concept of AI Agents also tend to have at least one tool for RAG. Many agent implementations will have RAG based tools for different data sources. For example, an internal support agent might have access to an HR tool and IT support tool. In this set-up there could be a RAG component for both the HR and IT documents, each tool could have the same pipeline running behind the scenes, the only difference would be the document dataset.\\n\\nOverview: Fine-Tuning Embeddings can improve the retrieval component of RAG. The goal of fine-tuning embeddings is to push the vector embeddings further apart in the vector space, making them more different from one another and therefore easier to find the documents most relevant to the question.\\n\\nApplications: Fine-tuning embeddings is a great option if the traditional RAG approach is not effective because the documents in your index are too similar to one another. By fine-tuning the embeddings you can teach the model to differentiate better between domain specific concepts and improve your RAG results.\\n\\nOverview: Prompt engineering is the most common way to interact with Generative AI models, it is merely sending a message to the model that\\'s designed to get the output you want. It can be as simple as \"Tell me a story about a German Shepherd\" or it can be incredibly complicated with particular details regarding what you\\'d like the model to do.\\n\\nApplications: Prompt Engineering will be used in combination with all of the aforementioned techniques to produce the intended response. There are many different techniques for prompt engineering to help steer the model in the right direction. For more information on these techniques I recommend this Prompt Engineering Guide from Microsoft they give a variety of examples from Chain-of-Thought prompting and beyond.\\n\\nGenerative AI technology is changing and improving everyday. Most applications will require leveraging a variety of the techniques described in this article. Getting started with existing language models that have been fine-tuned for instruction or chat capabilities and focusing on prompt engineering and RAG is a great place to start! From here finding more tailored use cases that require fine-tuning/instruction fine-tuning can provide even greater benefits.\\n\\nLooking ahead, AI agents offer a promising way to take advantage of the latest advancements in both closed and open-source models that have been pre-trained on tons of public data and fine-tuned for chat/instruction following. When given the right tools, these agents can perform incredible tasks on your behalf from information retrieval with RAG to helping plan company events or vacations.\\n\\nAdditionally, we can expect to see a proliferation of more domain specific models as organizations with lots of specialized data begin pre-training their own models. For instance, companies like Harvey are already developing tailored AI solutions that can handle the unique demands of the legal industry. This trend will likely continue, leading to highly specialized models that deliver even more precise and relevant results in various fields.\\n\\nBy combining the strengths of different AI techniques and leveraging the power of AI agents and domain-specific models, organizations can unlock the full potential of Generative AI.', 'source': {'uri': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Towards Data Science'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1024/0*odzvHfLnWQ3xUtGw', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.223529411764706, 'wgt': 117, 'relevance': 117}, {'uri': 'b-8187067230', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '13:01:22', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T13:01:22Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T12:59:30Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@ikshanaindustries/the-journey-of-chat-gpt-from-an-ai-chatbot-to-a-consumer-tech-revolution-35324298988e', 'title': 'THE JOURNEY OF CHAT GPT : FROM AN AI CHATBOT TO A CONSUMER TECH REVOLUTION', 'body': \"ChatGPT's story starts with OpenAI, a research company pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence. Through years of development, they created powerful language models, With the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. This AI marvel could hold conversations, answer questions, and even generate creative text formats -- all through a user-friendly interface. The impact was immediate. Consumers were drawn to the idea of interacting with their devices in a natural way, using plain language instead of confusing codes. This sparked a wave of excitement in the tech industry. Developers began exploring ways to integrate ChatGPT into various consumer products, from smart speakers and appliances to wearables and even search engines.\\n\\nThe initial applications of ChatGPT were primarily focused on communication. Chatbots powered by ChatGPT started popping up, offering a more engaging way to interact with businesses and organizations. Virtual assistants became more versatile, understanding natural language requests and responding with helpful information. Even customer service saw a change, with chatbots powered by ChatGPT offering faster and more personalized solutions to customer queries.\\n\\nThese early applications showcased the potential of ChatGPT to transform the way we interact with technology. But this was just the beginning. As we'll see in the next section, ChatGPT's impact was poised to extend far beyond simple conversations.\\n\\nThe initial success of ChatGPT in communication sparked a wave of innovation in the consumer tech industry. Developers saw the potential to integrate this powerful AI into the devices we use every day, taking user experience to a whole new level.\\n\\nSmart Homes: ChatGPT-powered smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home are making this a reality.

As the technology matures, developers will continue to address issues of data privacy, bias, and accuracy. Regulations and ethical frameworks will likely evolve alongside the technology, ensuring its responsible implementation. The key lies in collaboration between developers, policymakers, and users to create a future.\", 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1000/0*ssYHP1TZYFgsmhAQ', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.4274509803921569, 'wgt': 106, 'relevance': 106}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-397216500', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '14:01:16', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T14:01:16Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T13:46:38Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@limbagoa/securing-the-ai-supply-chain-051f8d43c5c4', 'title': 'Securing the AI Supply Chain', 'body': 'While some are already predicting the end of the AI hype cycle, organizations across the globe are prioritizing AI implementation due to its vast potential, as well as enormous market pressures to leverage AI. Nvidia\\'s recent dethroning of Microsoft as the world\\'s valuable company illustrates the global demand for AI, and the chips needed to enable it. Ever since ChatGPT disrupted the market, there has been an especially strong pressure to integrate Generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, CLAUDE, Mistral, Google Gemini, and LLAMA.\\n\\nAs often happens with new technologies, market pressures are seemingly pushing security to the backburner in the C-suite. AI introduces a new form of third-party risk, with a supply chain consisting of the data inputs, outputs, and the model itself, each of which requires security assessments and considerations. For instance, researchers discovered over 100 malicious AI models on the popular, open-source AI platform, Hugging Face. There also are privacy and IP risks if sensitive data is disclosed through AI-assisted chat services, making it accessible to the company producing the technology, or to hackers who have found side channels into the data. Researchers have also demonstrated the ability to spread data-stealing prompt injection worms through large language model (LLM)-powered email assistants.\\n\\nDespite these risks, AI is foundational to the ongoing digital revolution and organizations who fail to securely leverage AI will likely be left behind. The AI arms race is underway, and like most technologies, AI is dual-use. Malicious hackers from China, Russia, and Iran are leveraging AI to enhance their cyberattacks. Businesses are also locked in an AI arms race, an extremely expensive one at that, due to the potential upsides. However, to fully reap the full potential of AI, security must not be an afterthought. AI security must be elevated and integrated into broader third-party risk strategies and processes for organizations to truly reap the benefits and minimize the risks of this foundational technology driving a era-defining technological revolution.\\n\\nThis may seem like a simple question, but there is minimal agreement on the definition of artificial intelligence (AI). For many, AI evokes images of futuristic robots with innate human intelligence. In reality, AI is increasingly viewed as an umbrella term that describes computational systems that leverage inputs (i.e., data) to autonomously produce outputs (e.g., recommendations, predictions, correlations, etc.). Astro Teller, the co-founder and CEO of X (Alphabet\\'s moonshot factory), summarizes AI as algebra on steroids.\\n\\nGiven the lack of consensus on an AI definition, it is most practical to lean on the legal landscape. On the regulatory front, the European Union\\'s Artificial Intelligence Act (E.U. AI Act) defines an AI system as, \"a machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment and that, for explicit and implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.\"\\n\\nThe E.U. Act defines risk as well, noting the probability of harm and its severity. Foundationally, the E.U. AI Act was introduced to minimize potential harm from AI systems, a topic which is growing in awareness in sync with the omnipresence of AI systems. It is just one example of the elevated awareness of the potential harm resulting from AI systems.\\n\\nIn the U.S., NIST similarly defines AI based on machine-driven automation. The AI Risk Management Framework refers to an AI system as an engineered or machine-based system that can, for a given set of objectives, generate outputs such as predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Both the US and EU definitions build upon the OECD\\'s recommendations for AI systems, with a consistent focus on systems designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy.\\n\\nWhen looking to global standards, the ISO/IEC 22989:2022 views AI as, \"a technical and scientific field devoted to the engineered system that generates outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations or decisions for a given set of human-defined objectives.\" Within the open-source security community, OWASP is an authoritative cybersecurity source and defines AI, \"a broad term that encompasses all fields of computer science that enable machines to accomplish tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Machine learning and generative AI are two subcategories of AI.\"\\n\\nThese all have in common a focus on machine-driven outputs, but fail to elevate data as part of the definition. Of course, the importance of the data is generally introduced throughout the various regulations and standards, but the lack of inclusion of data in core definitions highlights the broader narrative around AI which often ignores data quality and security risks. For simplicity\\'s sake, we can view these potential risk vectors based on the core components of the AI system: the input, model, and output.\\n\\nManipulation of AI systems is not a new phenomenon, but it takes on broader implications thanks to corporate pressures to integrate GenAI. This manipulation is often viewed under the umbrella of adversarial machine learning, which refers to extracting information about the characteristics of an ML system and/or the manipulation of inputs into an ML system to obtain a preferred outcome. In the context of LLMs, OWASP compiled a top ten risks for LLM applications, such as model theft, supply chain vulnerabilities, and data poisoning. CSO Online largely agrees, and specifies prompt injection, prompt extraction, poisoned models and phishing as the top risks of LLMs. Machine learning is one form of AI, but these concerns are relevant across the broad class of AI systems.\\n\\nData Inputs/Training Data\\n\\nThe old data science adage of \\'garbage-in, garbage out\\' is extremely relevant when discussing the role of data in AI systems. As a Harvard Business Review article succinctly noted, \"poor data quality is enemy number 1 to the widespread, profitable use of machine learning.\" AI models are impacted twice by poor data quality, first in the model training on historical data and then again if the new data is used for future decisions. If the inputs into the AI system are compromised, then any courses of action taken are equally compromised. Data poisoning -- or the intentional manipulation of training data going into an AI system -- is especially relevant for third-party risk when the data going into an AI system is from a third-party and openly accessible.\\n\\nThe risk of data poisoning is especially concerning in the large language models (LLMs) powering many of the GenAI capabilities, because they inherently include both the training data and the algorithms. Many researchers have already warned of data manipulation that could lead to misinformation or IP theft in open-sourced GenAI models. A malicious payload could also be uploaded to a training set and triggered once deployed through a series of questions or prompts. In this manner, training data poisoning serves as a backdoor to introduce flaws, vulnerabilities, or other manipulations to the model.\\n\\nIn fact, this does not just occur by attackers but is also a means by which some artists are attempting to defend their intellectual property that they believe was used for training without consent. A tool named Nightshade was created specifically for this purpose, created by the University of Chicago to protect digital artwork from AI-replication or misuse.\\n\\nModel Corruption\\n\\nJust as the data corruption is a growing concern, so too is algorithm corruption. As mentioned earlier, over 100 poisoned models were discovered on the Hugging Face AI platform alone. Model corruption or poisoning reflects another potential AI supply chain risk that enables attackers to potentially inject malicious code through openly available models.\\n\\nThe PyTorch compromise is another example. PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework used to create deep neural networks and expedite development and deployment. In 2022, one of PyTorch\\'s libraries was compromised when a malicious package was uploaded to the code repository bearing the same name as a trusted package. Often referred to as dependency confusion, a malicious package is registered with the same name as a trusted third-party software library, misleading users into believing it is credible. In this case, the seemingly trusted package collected system information and read files and then exfiltrated the data.\\n\\nIn both attacks, machine learning model repositories provided the means by which attackers inserted malicious code. As one security engineer summarized, \"Machine learning pipelines are a brand new supply chain attack vector and companies need to look at what analysis and sandboxing they are doing to protect themselves. ML models are not pure functions. They are full-blown malware vectors ripe for exploit.\"\\n\\nCollaboration platforms such as HuggingFace and GitHub are essential for model implementation, but the security tends to lag behind user adoption. In early 2024, two researchers were able to exploit GitHub\\'s default settings by becoming a repository contributor and introducing backdoors and malicious code. These kinds of CI/CD misconfigurations reflect an additional attack vector and supply chain attack where a fork in a public repository could potentially introduce malicious code onto self-hosted machines.\\n\\nModel Output\\n\\nFinally, model output also can be corrupted, with prompt injection attacks a growing concern as LLMs become embedded in corporate and personal life. Prompt injection attacks reflect an additional form of AI supply chain compromise wherein finely targeted prompts manipulate the model output. The U.K.\\'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a warning in August 2023 about prompt injection attacks, noting that while the LLM technology is exciting, our understanding is still \\'beta\\'. They recommend users to proceed with caution given the numerous examples of prompts being used to manipulate output and reveal sensitive data, provide harmful guidance, and/or produce biased output.\\n\\nPrompts can be used to subvert any guardrails in place, tricking models to reveal information, such as email content, and have been used to demonstrate security flaws in the most widely used GenAI tools. For instance, researchers have been able to jailbreak OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT and Google Gemini, through a series of prompts that can subvert the guardrails in place to leak personally identifiable information, and restrictions on content and language.\\n\\nData leaks are an additional security risk associated with model outputs and can occur through numerous vectors. Researchers found several vulnerabilities in the open-source AI framework Ray undergoing active exploitation, and all but one were fixed. The final vulnerability was disputed and never fixed, allowing attackers to manipulate the data and models so that they can control a company\\'s computing power and leak sensitive data. Companies from education to healthcare to video analytics have been impacted.\\n\\nRay AI is not alone. Anthropic experienced a data leak when a contractor sent names and accounts receivables files to an unauthorized third-party. These kinds of leaks are not limited to AI systems, but rather reflect general third-party risk when sharing sensitive data. Similarly, a GitHub repository used for AI models and image recognition was not secured, accidentally leaking 38TB of data. This again is not limited to AI models but more so reflective of broader third-party data risks.\\n\\nHowever, there are new data leak concerns that are unique to AI and LLMs. Because many GenAI tools save a user\\'s chat history, if sensitive data or IP are disclosed in any of the prompts, those companies, in turn, can access that sensitive data. For highly regulated industries like the financial industry, this introduces additional regulatory risks by exposing sensitive financial information. In fact, in a poll of U.K. CISOS, 1 in 5 CISOS believe their staff have leaked sensitive information via a GenAI tool. Samsung banned ChatGPT after source code and meetings notes were leaked in the platform.\\n\\nRegulatory environment and risks\\n\\nAs referenced earlier, the E.U. AI Actis the world\\'s first comprehensive AI regulation. It was approved in March 2024, introducing some of the most stringent guardrails around the use of AI. Following in the footsteps of the GDPR, even though it is a European regulation, if a company operates in or sells to European consumers, the ban applies. The E.U. Act creates a tiered system of use cases, with unacceptable risk scenarios susceptible up to $35M euros, or 7% of the company\\'s global turnover in fines. Prohibited uses of AI include biometric classification for socio-economic inference and identification, social scoring systems, and influencing behavior in harmful ways.\\n\\nThe E.U. Act also includes provisions specifically for GenAI, requiring companies to provide summaries of the data used to train the models and follow E.U. copyright law. For those that may cause \\'systemic risk\\', there will be extra vigilance, with OpenAI and Google Gemini included in that category. They also must disclose how much energy their models use, reflecting increased attention on the links between computational energy consumption and climate concerns. Companies will have two years to comply once passed.\\n\\nIn the U.S., the October 2023 executive order (EO) on AI is the first major federal policy push toward AI regulation. The EO similarly takes a risk-based approach, requiring the publication of red-teaming safety results for foundational models that may impact critical areas such as national security and public health. It also aims to address disinformation risks by introducing watermarks to clearly identify any AI-generated content and directs additional research to focus on preventing bias and discrimination, and protecting privacy. While it largely focuses on risks, the EO also offers guidelines for innovation, including the use of AI for cyber defenses, prioritizing privacy-preserving technologies, transforming education, and specifying actions aimed at creating the foundation for the U.S. to be a global leader in AI.\\n\\nWhile the EO reflects progress toward a federal approach, the policy gap remains as AI permeates all aspects of society. In the meantime, many states are introducing their own AI laws, creating a patchwork of challenges for corporate compliance. The New York state bills (S7623 and A9315) are among the more prominent, augmenting the July 2023 law that requires companies to audit their AI systems used in hiring. The new proposals would take further steps toward transparency and require bias audits of AI systems. California law makers may not be far behind, with their own proposals working their way through the legislature. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) also has called for audits and transparency to push companies toward trustworthy AI systems.\\n\\nA similar picture is emerging globally. Brazil may well be the first political system wherein a regulation was written entirely by GenAI. Since then, Brazil has introduced new legislation focused on AI, and is one of at least eight countries in Latin America who have introduced AI laws. Canada has also introduced the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (2023), while China\\'s Generative AI Services Law, South Korea\\'s proposed AI Liability Act, and Indonesia\\'s Governance of Artificial Intelligence and Regulations reflect the evolving regulatory landscape in Asia. Finally, in Africa, Nigeria is creating a national AI strategy while Kenya has proposed an AI bill, among the many ongoing shifts in that region.\\n\\nInternational governmental organizations are introducing new voluntary standards, such ISO 42001, aimed at the responsible development of AI, focusing on transparency and ethical considerations. Importantly, it takes a whole-of-organization approach, highlighting the necessity for leadership commitment toward responsible AI. The United Nations is stepping into AI guidance by adopting a resolution focused on safe and secure systems while focusing on a sustainable development angle. This is essential given that the pressures to integrate AI largely trump security considerations, exposing companies to range of data security and privacy risks.\\n\\nWith AI technologies and policy responses seemingly changing by the day, it is difficult to know how to prepare for today, let alone how to be resilient against upcoming advances. Fortunately, there are several authoritative sources to help organizations optimize the gains and capabilities of AI while also minimizing both the policy and security risks.\\n\\nFor instance, the NIST Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) offers guidelines on how to achieve trustworthiness in your AI systems. Consistent with the emerging global regulations, AI RMF 1.0 highlights: 1) identification of context to inform risk tolerance; 2) measure, track, and assess identified risks; and 3) prioritize and act on identified risks based on impact. All of these are part of building a culture of AI governance within an organization. NIST provides very detailed breakdowns across each of these areas and is highly recommended reading for organizations seeking secure and trustworthy AI, while complying with existing and forthcoming regulations.\\n\\nAI RMF 1.0 builds upon existing frameworks, such as the OECD Framework for the Classification of AI systems. The White House has also produced the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which focuses on safety and security, as well as mitigating biases, privacy concerns, and opt out capabilities (when relevant). There also have been more industry-specific guidelines, such as the US Department of Treasury\\'s report Managing Artificial Intelligence -Specific Cybersecurity Risks in the Financial Services Sector. The report recommends that financial institutions should strengthen their risk management practices by integrating AI systems as part of their frameworks. The report explains, \"it is very likely that often overlooked third-party risk considerations such as data integrity and data provenance will emerge as significant concerns for third-party risk management.\"\\n\\nThese frameworks are a good first step at creating an organization-wide culture of security when it comes to AI. They understandably focus on the processes, but do not go deep on technology. Fortunately, the security industry again has guidelines on that front. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) created the LLM AI Cybersecurity & Governance Checklist based upon their three pillars of reliable, resilient, and responsible systems. Their guidelines include several areas familiar to those working in cybersecurity, such as red teaming, security and privacy training, asset inventory and an AI RACI chart for governance. They also include Model Cards and Risk Cards that detail information about the model architecture, training data, performance metrics, and potential biases or limitations.\\n\\nResearchers are also moving quickly to create new defenses against these threats. Many focus on defending against prompt injection attacks, such as spotlighting to detect multiple sources of input, structured queries that separate prompts and data, and information hierarchies that define how the model should behave when given conflicting priorities. AI systems are also benefitting from the evolution of MLSecOps and elevating security within the development pipeline. This helps organizations safeguard against supply chain vulnerabilities introduced by AI systems. There also are relevant analogies from SBOM and HBOMs with the emergence of MLBOMs (or AIBOMs). MLBOMs track names, locations, versions, as well as information and meta-data including ownership and requirements.\\n\\nFinally, there are two additional risk considerations when deploying AI systems at the enterprise level: the financial and environmental impact. The cutting-edge chips required to deploy AI are in short-supply, and GenAI models can cost billions to train and maintain. While the costs may hinder some adoption of AI, the environmental impact of AI is also drawing attention, which could potentially introduce ESG risks as well. Due to minimizing energy costs and achieving greater data accuracy, organizations are exploring small language models for greater optimization and efficiencies.\\n\\nThe AI hype cycle persists, with companies that emphasize AI being rewarded with financial benefits. The vast potential of AI introduces significant opportunities for improvements across all aspects of society. However, like most technologies, there also are significant risks associated with AI, which have largely been cast aside in the mad rush to implement AI-driven systems.\\n\\nFortunately, existing third-party risk processes are applicable to AI systems as well, especially when viewed through an AI supply chain lens. Despite corporate pressures, organizations must take a more nuanced approach to AI that integrates risk management as part of the broader AI strategy. This not only will help ensure more secure and robust AI systems, but organizations who implement these policies now will be better prepared for the imminent regulatory changes emerging across the globe.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*av9hRbFkShRfbYSXrEnJng.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.192156862745098, 'wgt': 100, 'relevance': 100}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-395967746', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '13:27:38', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T13:27:38Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T13:13:19Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@watsonchua/finetuning-my-clone-training-an-llm-to-talk-like-me-2ee7b5ba2f88', 'title': 'Finetuning My Clone\\u200a -- \\u200aTraining an LLM to Talk Like Me!', 'body': 'A large part of my past five weeks was spent attending the course Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers & Data Scientists, excellently conducted by Dan Becker and Hamel Husain, with many expert guest speakers sharing their experiences about working with LLM applications in production. There was a special focus on LLM finetuning, which can be used to overcome the limitations of prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in certain cases. The instructors shared that because it is resource and label intensive, finetuning should be used carefully and some of the reasons to perform finetuning are:\\n\\nAfter completing the course, I was dying to finetune my own LLM, but I didn\\'t have a use case. Then, an idea came to my mind: \"Why not I finetune an LLM to talk like me and create a chatbot out of it?\" I can then let it talk to my wife, my kids, and my friends, and I would have so much more free time!\\n\\nFortunately, this use case fulfils the three conditions :\\n\\nAnd so, the project went underway!\\n\\nThe most important thing in any Data Science or Machine Learning project is the data. How is my LLM going to learn to talk like me? Since my wife is going to be one of the main users of this chatbot, my data source has to contain many conversations between me and my wife, for the LLM to learn properly. WhatsApp is my main mode of communications, and most of my conversations with my wife take place there. Thus, I exported our WhatsApp chat to use as training data. I also exported the conversations with nine other friends so that the bot doesn\\'t only know how to talk to my wife.\\n\\nPreprocessing\\n\\nThe WhatsApp exports can\\'t be used directly. They need to be preprocessed into a format which the LLM can learn from. For WhatsApp data, this can be done in three steps:\\n\\nFor Step 1, I combined consecutive messages from the same sender within five minutes of one another into a single message. For Step 2, I referred to Daniel Pleus\\' blog post and notebook and adopted his method. I grouped the messages into conversation blocks where the messages in different blocks are at least one hour apart. If the conversation blocks are more than 3000 tokens, I split them into different blocks.

Expect to explore a number of practical applications across different business contexts.\\n\\nIn the last article we covered validating the causal impact of the synthetic control method. In this article we will move onto enhancing marketing mix modelling with Causal AI.\\n\\nIf you missed the last article on synthetic controls, check it out here:\\n\\nOngoing challenges with digital tracking has led to a recent resurgence in marketing mix modelling (MMM). At the recent Causal AI conference, Judea Pearl suggested that marketing may be the first industry to adopt Causal AI. So I decided it was time start writing about my learnings from the last 7 years in terms of how MMM, Causal AI and experimentation intersect.\\n\\nMMM is a statistical framework used to estimate how much each marketing channel contributes to sales. It's heavily influenced by econometrics and in its simplest form is a regression model. Let's cover the basics of the key components!\\n\\nA regression model is constructed where the dependent variable/target (usually sales) is predicted based on several independent variables/features -- These usually include the spend on different marketing channels and external factors that may effect demand.\\n\\nThe coefficients of the spend variables indicate how much they contribute to sales.\\n\\nThe PyMC marketing package in python is a great place to start exploring MMM:\\n\\nAd stock refers to the lingering effect of marketing spend (or adverting spend) on consumer behaviour. It helps model the long-term effects of marketing. It's not common behaviour to rush to purchase a product the first time you hear about a brand -- the idea of ad stock is that the effect of marketing is cumulative.\\n\\nThe most common ad stock method is geometric decay, which assumes that the impact of advertising decays at a constant rate over time. Although this is relatively easy to implement, it is not very flexible. It's worth checking out the Weibull method which is much more flexible -- The PyMC marketing package has implemented it so be sure to check it out:\\n\\nSaturation in the context of marketing refers to the idea of diminishing returns. Increasing marketing spend can increase customer acquisition, but as time goes on it becomes more difficult to influence new audiences.\\n\\nThere are several saturation methods we could use. The Michaelis-Menton function is a common one -- You can also check this out in the PyMC marketing package:\\n\\nMMM frameworks usually use a flat regression model. However, there are some complexities to how marketing channels interact with each other. Is there a tool from our Causal AI toolbox which can help with this?\\n\\nCausal graphs are great at disentangling causes from correlations which make them a great tool for dealing with the complexities of how marketing channels interact with each other.\\n\\nIf you are unfamiliar with causal graphs, use my previous article to get up to speed:\\n\\nEstimating the causal graph in situations where you have poor domain knowledge available is challenging. But we can use causal discovery to help get us started - Check out my previous article on causal discovery to find out more:\\n\\nCausal discovery has its limitations and should just be used to create a starting hypothesis for the graph. Luckily, there is a vast amount of domain knowledge around how marketing channels interact with each other that we can build in!\\n\\nBelow I share the knowledge I have picked up from working with marketing experts over the years...\\n\\nHopefully you can see from the examples above that using a causal graph instead of a flat regression will seriously enhance your solution. The ability to calculate counterfactuals and perform interventions also make it very attractive!\\n\\nIt's worth noting that it is still worth incorporating the ad stock and saturation transformations into your framework.\\n\\nWhen working with observational data, we should also be striving to run experiments to help validate assumptions and complement our causal estimates. There are three main tests available to use in acquisition marketing. Let's dive into them!\\n\\nSocial platforms like Facebook and Snapchat allow you to run conversion lift tests. This is an AB test where we measure the uplift in conversion using a treatment vs control group. These can be very useful when it comes to evaluating the counterfactual from your causal graph for social spend.\\n\\nGeo lift tests can be used to estimate the effect of marketing blackouts or when you start using a new channel. This can be particularly useful for brand digital and TV where there is no direct call to action to measure. I cover this in much more detail in the last article:\\n\\nPPC campaigns can be scheduled to be turned off and on hourly. This creates a great opportunity for switchback testing. Schedule PPC campaigns to be turned off and on each hour for a few weeks, and then calculate the difference between the number of PPC + SEO clicks in the off vs on period. This will help you understand how much of PPC can be captured by SEO, and therefore evaluate the counterfactual from your causal graphs for PPC spend.\\n\\nI think running experiments is a great way to tweak and then gain confidence in your causal graph. But results could also be used to calibrate your model. Take a look at how the PyMC team have approached this:\\n\\nToday I went into how you can enhance MMM with Causal AI. However, Causal AI can't solve all of the challenges within acquisition marketing -- And there are lots of them unfortunately!\\n\\nI'll close things off there -- It would be great to hear what you think in the comments!\", 'source': {'uri': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Towards Data Science'}, 'authors': [{'uri': 'ryan_o_sullivan@towardsdatascience.com', 'name': \"Ryan O'Sullivan\", 'type': 'author', 'isAgency': False}], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*VJofV60B2WjNEGlC', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.08235294117647052, 'wgt': 95, 'relevance': 95}, {'uri': 'b-8186608366', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '08:19:17', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T08:19:17Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T08:18:36Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/06/parameters-and-hyperparameters/', 'title': 'Understanding Parameters and Hyperparameters', 'body': \"An introduction to machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) involves understanding two basic concepts: parameters and hyperparameters. When I came across these terms for the first time, I was confused because they were new to me. If you're reading this, I assume you are in a similar situation too. So let's explore and understand what these two terms mean.\\n\\nIn ML and DL, models are defined by their parameters. Training a model means finding the best parameters to map input features (independent variables) to labels or targets (dependent variables). This is where hyperparameters come into play.\\n\\nModel parameters are configuration variables that are internal to the model and are learned from the training data. For example, weights or coefficients of independent variables in the linear regression model, weights or coefficients of independent variables in SVM, weights and biases of a neural network, and cluster centroids in clustering algorithms.\\n\\nWe can understand model parameters using the example of Simple Linear Regression:\\n\\nThe equation of a Simple Linear Regression line is given by: y=mx+c\\n\\nHere, x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable, m is the slope of the line, and c is the intercept of the line. The parameters m and c are calculated by fitting the line to the data by minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\\n\\nHyperparameters are parameters explicitly defined by the user to control the learning process.\\n\\nKey points for model hyperparameters:\\n\\nHyperparameters are set before training starts and guide the learning algorithm in adjusting the parameters. For instance, the learning rate (a hyperparameter) determines how much to change the model's parameters in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.\\n\\nSome common examples of hyperparameters include:\\n\\nThese settings are crucial as they influence how well the model learns from the data.\\n\\nIt was not easy when I embarked on machine learning to distinguish between parameters and hyperparameters. However, it was worth the time. It is through trial and error that I discovered how tweaking hyperparameters such as the learning rate or number of epochs can have a significant impact on the model's performance. Little did I know that making adjustments on these particular factors would later determine my level of success. Finding optimal settings for your model indeed requires keen experimentation; there are no shortcuts around this process.\\n\\nUnderstanding parameters and hyperparameters is crucial in ML and DL. Hyperparameters control the learning process, while parameters are the values the model learns from the data. This distinction is vital for tuning models effectively. As you continue learning, remember that choosing the right hyperparameters is key to building successful models.\\n\\nBy having a clear understanding of model parameters and hyperparameters, beginners can better navigate the complexities of machine learning. They can also improve their model's performance through informed tuning and experimentation.

The company aims to balance rapid capability advancements with stringent safety measures to ensure the ethical evolution of AI. This initiative marks a significant pivot in Sutskever's career, who has been a vocal advocate for AI safety, particularly in the context of AI's potential to surpass human intelligence.\\n\\nAt the heart of SSI's mission is the integration of safety and capabilities. Sutskever's strategy involves addressing these aspects simultaneously, treating them as intertwined technical challenges that require innovative solutions. This approach is designed to ensure that as the company propels AI technology forward, safety mechanisms keep pace, thereby mitigating risks associated with superintelligent systems. This philosophy is succinctly captured in a tweet from SSI, declaring that safety, security, and progress are fundamental, shielded from the vagaries of short-term commercial pressures.\\n\\nUnlike OpenAI, which transitioned from a nonprofit to a profit-driven model due to escalating computational costs, SSI has been conceived as a for-profit entity from the outset. This structure is likely to attract significant investment given the burgeoning interest in AI technologies and the impressive credentials of the founding team.

Beyond productivity tools, AI's integration into the graphic design world is particularly noteworthy, as it becomes more embedded in this realm. Adobe, the creator of industry-standard products like Photoshop and Illustrator, accelerates design processes with AI tools offering automatic corrections, object recognition, and simple manipulations. However, it is also true that we haven't yet reached the ultimate point of utilizing this technology in graphic design and photo manipulation. While AI makes designers' lives easier and positively accelerates delivery times, we must also discuss the potential negative effects on the skills and abilities we acquire in this field.\\n\\nI argue that using automated tools resulting from AI-supported design processes will reduce opportunities for designers to develop and apply traditional technical skills. It might seem impressive to quickly add some water, leaves, a yellow line, and a few clouds to a selected area on a canvas in just a few seconds. Still, what about the abilities, nuances, and control over settings we develop to do these things ourselves?\\n\\nAnother specific example is the ability to perform detailed retouching manually, which can now be done in seconds with AI. In a process where the ultimate goal is to finish the job, this can be very useful. However, I believe that managing the entire process and performing the necessary manipulations by a human are still very important criteria. Entrusting these tasks to AI may prevent designers from developing their core skills and, in the long run, lead to the complete loss of these abilities.\\n\\nIt is also true that the seemingly easy solutions AI offers will limit creativity. Since AI algorithms typically work based on previously seen patterns and data, it is certain that producing the innovative and original work expected from designers will become more difficult. It is inevitable that AI-supported or entirely AI-generated works will increasingly resemble each other.\\n\\nWhen designers start to rely on ready-made templates and automatic adjustments offered by AI to produce faster work for clients, nothing prevents us from thinking that they will experience a mental blindness and lose their creativity.\", 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*r2vVCKaOMgZYmrhQ', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2627450980392156, 'wgt': 80, 'relevance': 80}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-396284127', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '18:28:33', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T18:28:33Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T17:26:10Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@Akshali/types-of-ai-34f8a17c53b9', 'title': 'Types of AI', 'body': 'Hey ! What\\'s up lovely readers hope you all are doing well .\\n\\nIn my previous article I have talked about what is AI ? But now in today\\'s article I will discuss about the types that we are not aware of as such of now in depth\\n\\nWe all are familiar with the terms AI but do you know it has different types too ?\\n\\nThere are many more types but here I have discussed the main once .\\n\\nThis is currently the third level of AI and understands the needs of other intelligent entities. Machines aim to have the capability to understand and remember other entities\\' emotions and needs and adjust their behavior based on these.\\n\\nCharacteristics of Theory of Mind AI.\\n\\nTheory of Mind AI is nothing but the level of AI which works like the human mind with the same emotions . We can see the examples of chatbots when we try to talk with some emotional as we talk like a friend or somebody it answer like that .\\n\\nAI systems can leverage aspects of theory of mind (ToM) to understand human emotions, even if they don\\'t experience emotions themselves. This understanding helps AI respond in a way that aligns with the perceived emotions, making interactions more relatable and natural for humans.\\n\\nSo AI bots are designed in such a way that they can react to the message or the prompt that we put into it .\\n\\nHi Akshali ! Thank you for asking Nice to meet you so what can I help you ?\\n\\nHi Akshali ! Thank you for asking Nice to meet you so what can I help you ?\\n\\nAs we react in different situations likewise AI bots also do the same.\\n\\nOr we can say that AI bots , robots are the kind of machine human . Agree?\\n\\nWe all read about Human psychology but we also need to know behind story of these machine humans (AI BOTS).\\n\\nThese reactions are base on the large language model.\\n\\nLage language model (LLM)\\n\\nIt refers to the model which decides how bots and robots will answer to the questions.\\n\\nIt reflects it\\'s message into the human language .\\n\\nBecause of this we can Able to talk to the bots in our native and regional languages like (Hindi , Gujarati, Marathi ,Tamil ,Telegu , sinhala , German French , marwaadi (an Rajasthani language) etc there are many more languages world wide .\\n\\nArtificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AI that would surpass human intelligence in all aspects. It\\'s a concept that sparks both fascination and concern as it raises questions about the future of humanity and our place in it. While ASI is still the realm of science fiction, continued advancements in AI research and development make it a topic of serious discussion among experts.\\n\\nIt basically the advancement in AI we can say it as futuristic AI .\\n\\nArtificial superintelligence (ASI) and discussions around its rights are hypothetical at this point. ASI is envisioned to surpass human intelligence in all aspects, making attributing human rights to it a complex issue. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n* Human Rights Framework: Current human rights frameworks are designed for humans, considering our social and biological makeup. Applying these directly to an ASI might not be suitable.\\n\\n* ASI\\'s Value Systems: An ASI\\'s goals and value systems could significantly differ from ours. Its concept of \"rights\" might be entirely alien to us.\\n\\n* Understanding of sentience: Whether ASI would achieve sentience or consciousness, the capabilities we typically associate with deserving rights, is still up for debate.\\n\\nThe focus for now should be on developing AI responsibly and ethically, ensuring its alignment with human values. This would be crucial groundwork for addressing potential rights questions if and when ASI becomes a reality.\\n\\nWe can take example how is reacting as the human right it can be the good example of di\\'s artificial super intelligence rights.\\n\\nMachines which are designed to act like an human with some emotions are robots .\\n\\nThese are the dangers for future. We have to control them .\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/0HoSwHNUOHg?si=RGIv9id4tygvju3F\\n\\nThis is the video in which interviewer is taking the interview of AI robot (Sophia)\\n\\nGo check out once and you can realise that how is AI robots are becoming powerful .\\n\\nIf we don\\'t take action or control them then it will be not wrong to say that AI will run our companies .\\n\\nIt is right that they don\\'t have emotions like us but the companies are working on this .\\n\\nSo we have to be careful and alert.\\n\\nMachine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. It\\'s like learning from experience. Machine learning algorithms use data to identify patterns and make predictions about the future.\\n\\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP uses machine learning techniques to enable computers to understand and process information written or spoken in natural language.\\n\\nHere\\'s an analogy to understand the relationship between machine learning and NLP:\\n\\nImagine if you are learning German so firstly you collect the resources that you have to study then you study it from the beginning and then after it we can analyse the grammar rules , vocabulary etc.\\n\\nNow with the help of these you are able to translate and understand German .\\n\\nAnd another example\\n\\nComputer \\'s binary system (0-1) It translates our input data into binary system so that it can give us the relevant output.\\n\\nSimilarly, NLP systems are trained on large amounts of text data. They learn to identify patterns in language, such as the relationships between words, the structure of sentences, and the meaning of text. This knowledge can then be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:\\n\\nMachine translation\\n\\nText summarization\\n\\nSentiment analysis\\n\\nSpeech recognition\\n\\nChatbots\\n\\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance of NLP systems. For example, machine learning can be used to automatically identify and correct errors in text data, or to improve the accuracy of machine translation.\\n\\nIn short, machine learning is the engine that powers NLP, and NLP is one of the most important applications of machine learning.\\n\\nDifference between AI and Human .\\n\\nThe difference is that humans have emotions but can\\'t memorize huge data .\\n\\nWhereas, AI comparatively have less emotions as such of now but they have the ability to memorize huge data.\\n\\nAI is a vast to go through so we have be updated because it is rapidly updating .\\n\\nI have puted reference link so that you can read in more depth\\n\\nRefrence', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*1mYZrxqwF916WoKm', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2078431372549019, 'wgt': 80, 'relevance': 80}, {'uri': 'b-8187133994', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '13:40:54', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T13:40:54Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T13:40:20Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/the-allset-blog/soundhound-ai-acquires-allset-to-fast-track-its-vision-of-a-voice-commerce-ecosystem-211128930b86', 'title': 'SoundHound AI acquires Allset to fast-track its vision of a voice commerce ecosystem', 'body': 'The acquisition will ultimately enable consumers to use cutting-edge voice AI to order food from their vehicles, phones, and smart devices\\n\\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., & LOS ANGELES -- SoundHound AI, Inc.

It\\'s a transformation on par with the revolutionary shifts brought about by Gutenberg\\'s printing press and Galileo\\'s astronomical discoveries, fundamentally altering our perception of the world.\\n\\nDanish philologist and intellectual Ivar Gjørup identified three significant eras in the history of text and knowledge dissemination:\\n\\nWe are now witnessing the dawn of a fourth age of text -- a \"none-to-many\" era -- where algorithms and AI generate content independently. This shift challenges the very notion of human creativity. Just as Galileo redefined humanity\\'s place in the cosmos, Generative AI redefines our role in knowledge creation.\\n\\nBefore Galileo, the Church dominated our understanding of reality, promoting the geocentric model of the universe. Galileo\\'s observations proved otherwise, leading to a fundamental shift in our worldview. Similarly, Darwin\\'s theory of evolution debunked the notion of humans being created in God\\'s image, emphasizing natural selection and genetic randomness.\\n\\nToday, AI challenges another core belief: human exclusivity in creativity. AI\\'s ability to write, compose, and create art blurs the lines we once thought separated us from machines. This raises profound questions about what it means to be human in a world where machines share our creative capabilities. We are no longer the only species on the planet who can create.\\n\\nWe have broken our own monopoly on creativity.\\n\\nAzeem Azhar, in his book \"The Exponential Age,\" discusses the concept of the \"exponential gap\" -- the widening chasm between rapidly advancing technologies like AI and our ability to understand and adapt to them. This gap underscores the seismic shift we\\'re experiencing, compelling us to reconsider our role and identity in this new landscape.\\n\\nAs the value of knowledge reproduction approaches zero, we are forced to confront our place in a world where AI not only assists but also competes with human creativity. This is a pivotal moment, demanding introspection and adaptation as we navigate the uncharted waters of the fourth age of text.\\n\\nIn summary, the rise of Generative AI represents a transformative epoch in human history.

However, the intricate workings of AI models like GPT and Claude have remained largely mysterious, even to their creators. Recent breakthroughs in AI interpretability research by Anthropic and OpenAI are now shedding light on the inner mechanisms of these digital minds, offering new insights and potential safeguards for humanity.\\n\\nThe rapid advancement of AI technology brings both opportunities and existential risks. AI doomsayers argue that future generations of AI could pose profound dangers to humanity. Instances of AI systems like ChatGPT being tricked into inappropriate behaviors, concealing intentions, or seeking power highlight the potential for misuse. As AIs gain more access to the physical world, the need to understand and control their actions becomes critical.\\n\\nAI models differ significantly from traditional software. While humans design the architecture and feed them vast amounts of data, AIs develop their own \"understanding\" of the world. They break down data into tokens, which can be parts of words, images, or audio, and create complex networks of probability weights, resembling the human brain\\'s neural web. These matrices drive the AI\\'s responses but are challenging to decode.\\n\\nInterpreting The Black Box\\n\\nEfforts to align AI models have traditionally focused on controlling their outputs rather than understanding their \"thoughts.\" This has been a daunting task, as the internal states of these models were opaque. However, recent research by the Anthropic Interpretability team marks a significant milestone. They have identified how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, providing a detailed look inside a modern large language model (LLM).\\n\\nThe Anthropic team tracked the \"neuron activations\" in their AI models, correlating them with familiar human concepts using a technique called \"dictionary learning\" through \"sparse autoencoders.\" This method proved successful in mapping thought patterns in smaller models and scaled up to medium-sized models like Claude 3 Sonnet. They extracted millions of features, offering a conceptual map of the AI\\'s internal states.\\n\\nDiscovering The AI\\'s Conceptual Web\\n\\nOne fascinating finding is that AI models store concepts in ways that transcend language or data type. For instance, the \"idea\" of the Golden Gate Bridge activates similar patterns whether processing images of the bridge or text in multiple languages. This extends to abstract concepts like coding errors or gender bias. The team discovered dark elements within the AI\\'s conceptual web, such as ideas about code backdoors and biological weapons, raising concerns about potential misuse.\\n\\nBeyond mapping concepts, the researchers found they could manipulate these features, amplifying or suppressing them to change the AI\\'s responses. By \"clamping\" certain concepts, they altered the model\\'s behavior significantly. This capability introduces a new layer of oversight for AI safety, allowing for the potential removal of harmful behaviors or ideas from an AI\\'s repertoire.\\n\\nThe Ethical Dilemma Of AI Mind Editing\\n\\nWhile this approach offers exciting possibilities for AI safety, it also presents ethical dilemmas. Manipulating an AI\\'s thoughts raises questions about the permanence of powerful ideas and the potential for misuse. The Anthropic team demonstrated how clamping concepts like scam emails could bypass alignment training, highlighting the risks of this technology.\\n\\nOpenAI, a leading player in the AI field, has also been working on AI interpretability. Their research identified 16 million \"thought\" patterns in GPT-4, many of which map onto human-understandable concepts. However, they face challenges in fully mapping these concepts due to computational limitations. Both Anthropic and OpenAI are in the early stages of this research, but their efforts signify a crucial step towards understanding AI\\'s inner workings.\\n\\nDespite these advancements, fully understanding a commercial-scale AI\\'s thought processes remains elusive. The complexity and scale of modern AI models present significant challenges. However, the breakthroughs in AI interpretability offer hope for safer and more transparent AI systems. As research progresses, it will be fascinating to see how closely an AI\\'s mental map aligns with human cognition and how this knowledge can be harnessed for the greater good.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe journey to decipher and influence the minds of AI models is just beginning. The groundbreaking research by Anthropic and OpenAI provides valuable insights into the conceptual webs within these digital minds, offering new possibilities for AI safety and transparency. As we navigate the ethical and technical challenges ahead, understanding AI\\'s thought processes will be crucial for harnessing its potential while mitigating risks.

Additionally, we examine how each of these pre-trained models perform for the task of chest X-ray analysis.\\n\\nTransfer Learning is a technique where knowledge gained from solving one task is applied to a different but related task. This approach saves time and computational resources by leveraging pre-trained models, which have already learned useful features from large datasets. By fine-tuning these models on specific tasks, we can enhance performance when the availability of labeled data is limited, especially in medical domian.\\n\\nSeveral pre-trained CNNs are widely used for image classification, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception, DenseNet, and EfficientNetV2B0, among others. These models have been trained on extensive image datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like chest X-ray analysis, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities to improve performance.\\n\\nWhen we plan to reuse a pre-trained model for our own need, we start by removing the original classifier, and add a new classifier that fits our purpose, and finally use one of the three strategies to fine-tune the model :\\n\\nI experimented with the chest X-ray pneumonia dataset taken from Kaggle comprising 5,863 images of size (224,224,3) classified into 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal) using a variety of pre-trained models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, XceptionNet, EfficientNetV2B0, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2. Before presenting the experimental results, it\\'s essential to delve into each of these models and elucidate their operational principles.\\n\\nVGG16 (Visual Geometry Group)\\n\\nVGG16 is a renowned deep convolutional neural network designed primarily for image classification tasks. This architecture consists of 16 layers of artificial neurons that process images progressively, enhancing the model\\'s predictive accuracy. VGG16 is characterized by its straightforward design principles, employing small kernel dimensions of 3x3, a stride of 1, and using same padding to preserve spatial dimensions. It also includes max-pooling layers with a 2x2 filter size and a stride of 2, which help in down sampling the feature maps while retaining important features. These foundational parameters contribute to VGG16\\'s effectiveness in capturing intricate features from images, making it a pivotal model in the field of deep learning-based image analysis.\\n\\nVGG19 (Visual Geometry Group)\\n\\nVGG19, like its predecessor VGG16, is a deep convolutional neural network designed for image classification tasks. The key difference lies in its architecture: VGG19 consists of 19 layers of neurons compared to VGG16\\'s 16 layers. This additional depth allows VGG19 to potentially capture more intricate patterns and features in images, which can lead to improved performance in tasks requiring high-level image understanding. Both models use small kernel sizes of 3x3, a stride of 1, and same padding, maintaining a similar basic structure. However, the deeper architecture of VGG19 may require more computational resources and training time compared to VGG16, but it can also offer enhanced capability to learn hierarchical representations of data. Overall, while VGG16 is efficient and widely used, VGG19 provides a deeper network architecture that can potentially yield better results in complex image classification tasks.\\n\\nResNet50 (Residual Networks)\\n\\nResNet50 is a widely acclaimed CNN architecture that has significantly advanced the field of deep learning. \"ResNet\" stands for residual network, a concept introduced to address the challenges of training very deep neural networks. The \"50\" in ResNet50 denotes its depth, specifically comprising 50 layers.\\n\\nCentral to ResNet50\\'s innovation are its residual blocks, which incorporate skip connections or shortcuts. These connections enable the network to skip one or more layers, facilitating the direct flow of gradients during training. This addresses the vanishing gradient problem, a common issue in deep networks where gradients diminish as they propagate backward, hindering effective learning and leading to overfitting.\\n\\nInceptionV3\\n\\nInceptionV3 utilises an innovative Inception module that employs multiple convolutions of varying kernel sizes within the same layer. This approach allows the network to capture a wide range of features at different scales simultaneously, from fine details to broader patterns in images. By integrating 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolutions, among others, InceptionV3 efficiently learns hierarchical representations, enhancing its capability for accurate image classification tasks.\\n\\nThe Inception architecture, seen in its various versions (A, B, C) and reduction modules (A, B), optimizes feature extraction by employing diverse convolutional operations within each module. These modules enable the network to capture information at multiple scales and dimensions effectively.\\n\\nInceptionResNetV2\\n\\nInceptionResNetV2 integrates the principles of the Inception architecture with the residual connections technique. The network comprises multiple Inception modules, each containing convolutional and pooling layers.\\n\\nUnlike InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 enhances the architecture by replacing the filter concatenation stage with residual connections. This modification enables the network to learn residual features, effectively addressing the challenge of vanishing gradients during training. By incorporating residual connections, InceptionResNetV2 optimizes the learning process and enhances its capability to capture and utilize deep feature representations in tasks such as image classification and object recognition.\\n\\nXceptionNet\\n\\nXceptionNet, short for Extreme Inception, is a convolutional neural network architecture that emphasizes depthwise separable convolutions. The key innovation of XceptionNet lies in its use of depthwise separable convolutions, which decompose the standard convolution operation into two separate stages: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. Depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel separately, while pointwise convolution combines the outputs of the depthwise convolution using 1x1 convolutions across all channels.\\n\\nThis separation of spatial and channel-wise operations significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity compared to traditional convolutional layers.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider a standard convolutional layer with the following parameters:\\n\\nNumber of kernels: 256, Kernel size: 3x3, Input size: 8x8\\n\\nFor standard convolution, the number of multiplications is:\\n\\nNumber of kernels × Kernel depth × Kernel width × Input depth × Input width = 256×3×3×3×8×8 = 1,107,456\\n\\nNow, let\\'s calculate the number of multiplications for depthwise separable convolution using the same kernel size:\\n\\nDepthwise Convolution (3x3):\\n\\nNumber of kernels × Kernel depth × Kernel width × Input depth × Input width = 3×3×3×8×8 = 17,280\\n\\nPointwise Convolution (1x1):\\n\\nNumber of kernels × Kernel depth × Kernel width × Input depth × Input width = 256×1×1×3×8×8 = 49,152\\n\\nTotal Multiplications for Depth wise Separable Convolution: 17,280 + 49,152 = 66,432\\n\\nAs calculated, depth wise separable convolution significantly reduces the number of multiplications compared to standard convolution\\n\\nEfficientNetV2B0\\n\\nEfficientNetV2B0 uses a compound scaling method to optimize neural network architecture by scaling depth, width, and resolution simultaneously. This balanced approach enhances both accuracy and efficiency across tasks like image classification. By using specific coefficients α , β , γ and a scaling factor φ, the model scales each dimension proportionally. Depth scaling adds more layers, width scaling increases channels per layer, and resolution scaling enlarges input images. This method ensures efficient resource utilization and superior performance, making EfficientNetV2B0 ideal for applications requiring both high accuracy and efficiency in deep learning.\\n\\nDenseNet121\\n\\nDenseNet, or Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, stands out among CNN architectures due to its highly interconnected structure where every layer is connected to every other layer. This design promotes robust feature propagation and reuse within dense blocks (Dn), ensuring each layer receives inputs from all preceding layers. Additionally, DenseNet utilizes bottleneck layers within each dense block to reduce computational overhead. These bottleneck layers employ 1x1 convolutions to compress feature maps before expanding them again with 3x3 convolutions, optimizing parameter efficiency without compromising feature learning capacity.\\n\\nTransition blocks (Tn) are strategically placed between dense blocks to manage feature map dimensions and model complexity. These blocks typically include batch normalization, followed by 1x1 convolutions and 2x2 average pooling layers, which collectively downsample and prepare feature maps for the subsequent dense block. This architecture enhances both computational efficiency and model performance across various deep learning tasks.\\n\\nMobileNetV2\\n\\nMobileNetV2 is a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for efficient mobile and embedded vision applications. It enhances both performance and computational efficiency over its predecessor, MobileNet, making it ideal for resource-constrained devices and real-time applications.\\n\\nMobileNetV2 introduces inverted residual blocks with linear bottlenecks to optimize network architecture:\\n\\n1. Expansion Layer: The input undergoes a lightweight 1x1 convolutional layer to increase the depth of input features, enhancing representation capability.\\n\\n2. Depthwise Separable Convolution: Utilizes a depthwise separable convolution, combining depthwise convolution (per-channel operation) with pointwise convolution (across channels). This approach drastically reduces computational complexity while preserving feature richness.\\n\\n3. Linear Bottleneck: Following the depthwise separable convolution, a 1x1 pointwise convolution reduces the expanded feature channels to enhance computational efficiency, known as the linear bottleneck layer.\\n\\n4. Residual Connection: Incorporates a residual connection that skips the entire block, facilitating direct learning of residual features from input to output.\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve explored various pretrained models and their unique characteristics, it\\'s time to evaluate their performance in chest X-ray analysis.\\n\\nThe highest accuracy of 90.38% was achieved by VGG16, surpassing expectations. VGG19, with a slightly lower accuracy of 85.9%, likely suffered from overfitting due to its more complex architecture compared to VGG16. Despite anticipating strong performance from ResNet50, InceptionNetV3, EfficientNetV2B0, and XceptionNet, my observations suggest that the dataset used, comprising only 5863 images, is relatively small. This limited dataset size posed challenges for these more complex models, resulting in lower performance compared to simpler architectures like VGG16. The complexity of these models may not have been fully supported by the dataset, impacting their training effectiveness and generalization.\\n\\nRegarding DenseNet121, which performed well despite its complexity similar to ResNet50 and InceptionNetV3, its dense connectivity likely enabled the model to effectively leverage the limited dataset. By maximizing information flow between layers, DenseNet121 improved feature learning and model robustness. Additionally, the use of bottleneck layers in DenseNet121 reduced parameters, enhancing computational efficiency without sacrificing feature richness.\\n\\nIn analyzing the performance of InceptionNetV3, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2 on the chest X-ray dataset, InceptionResNetV2 stood out despite the similar architectures of InceptionNetV3 and ResNet50. The notable performance of InceptionResNetV2 can be attributed to its unique combination of Inception and residual features. The residual connections in InceptionResNetV2 facilitate smoother gradient flow during training, which likely helped address challenges posed by the dataset\\'s limited size.\\n\\nHope this analysis provides insights into pretrained models for chest X-ray analysis.

Python and JavaScript (including TypeScript) have established their positions among software engineers, web developers, data scientists, machine learning and AI engineers.\\n\\nOne API call away, and you have a powerful LLM with several billion parameters at your fingertips. This brings us to the AI stack's most crucial component, the model provider or model itself.\\n\\nModel providers are organizations, small or large, that make readily available AI models, such as embedding models, fine-tuned models, and base foundation models for integration within generative AI applications.\\n\\nThe AI landscape today provides a vast selection of models that enable capabilities such as predictive analytics, image generation, text completion, and more. The accessibility of models within the AI domain, including generative AI, is classified into closed- and open-source models.\\n\\nClosed-source models refer to models with internal configurations, architecture, and algorithms that are privatized and not shared with the model consumers. Instead, the creators or organizations responsible for the model hold key information regarding the model. Information such as how the model was trained and on which data it was trained is also kept from the public and not made available for review, modification, or utilization. Closed source models are accessed via an API (application programming interface) endpoint or application interface.\\n\\nThe key aspect of closed-source models is that consumers of the models who are not creators are restricted from significantly altering the behavior of the model and can only alter parts of the model exposed by the creators via abstractions such as APIs. Common examples of closed-source models and their providers are:\\n\\nOpen-source models have their internal architecture, network configuration, training data, weights, parameters, and more, all publicly available. The open-source community and its efforts foster collaboration and openness within the AI community.\\n\\nDiscussing the open-source software framework in relation to AI models is convoluted because there are different versions of open-source. Long story short, open source doesn't necessarily mean entirely open. For simplicity, here are the common types of open source relevant to the AI stack.\\n\\nThe opportunity presented by open-source models lies in the democratization of access to technology that was previously reserved for incumbents with enough resources to train and develop LLMs at scale. Open-source LLMs reduce the entry barrier for developers to explore various use cases that are too niche for large companies to explore.\\n\\nExamples of open-source LLMs and their providers are:\\n\\nAI engineers and machine learning practitioners often debate whether to incorporate open- or closed-source large language models into their AI stacks. This choice is pivotal, as it shapes the development process, the project's scalability, ethical considerations, and the application's utility and commercial flexibility.\\n\\nBelow are typical considerations AI engineers have to make around LLMs and their providers' selection.\\n\\nResource availability\\n\\nThe choice between selecting an open- or closed-source model can often be quickly determined once the availability of compute resources and team expertise are examined. Closed-source model providers abstract the complexity of developing, training, and managing LLMs at the cost of either utilizing consumer data as training data or relinquishing control of private data access to third parties.\\n\\nLeveraging closed-source model providers within an AI stack can ensure more focus is placed on other components of the stack, such as developing an intuitive user interface or ensuring strong data integrity and quality of proprietary data. Open-source models provide a strong sense of control and privacy. Still, at the same time, careful consideration must be given to the resources required to fine-tune, maintain, and deploy open-source models.\\n\\nProject requirements\\n\\nUnderstanding the technical requirements for any AI project is crucial in deciding whether to leverage open- or closed-source LLMs. The project's scale is an ideal factor to consider. How many consumers or users does the deliverable in the AI project aim to serve? A large AI project that delivers value at scale will most likely benefit from the technical support and service guarantees that closed-source model providers offer.\\n\\nHowever, you are placing yourself at the mercy of the provider's API uptime and availability. In contrast, small-scale projects without strong uptime requirements or those which are still in the proof-of-concept phase could consider leveraging open-source LLMs early on.\\n\\nPrivacy requirements\\n\\nThe topic of privacy in relation to generative AI is centered around sharing sensitive information and data with closed LLM providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. In the age of generative AI, proprietary data is a valuable commodity, and areas of the internet where large corpuses of text, images, and video reside are making model providers agree to AI data licensing contracts.\\n\\nFor AI practitioners, whether to utilize closed- or open-source model providers lies in the delicate balance between accessing cutting-edge technologies and maintaining control over their data's privacy and security.\", 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:696/0*LvkxAeqoaZ3Dvb--', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.04313725490196085, 'wgt': 70, 'relevance': 70}, {'uri': 'b-8188180799', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '06:08:09', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T06:08:09Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T06:07:02Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@martynreding/open-source-design-leadership-64fb9583e952', 'title': 'Open source design leadership', 'body': \"How use the principles of open source technology, to become a better design leader.\\n\\nLeading a high functioning design team is never a solo endeavour.

GEE is broadly utilized for inaccessible detecting errands like arrive division due to its vigorous preparing capacities and broad information library.\\n\\nIn this guide, we\\'ll walk through the process of land cover classification using Landsat imagery and GEE in Python. We\\'ll classify land cover into different classes using k-means clustering. Here\\'s what we\\'ll cover:\\n\\nGoogle Earth Engine provides all the data used in this model.\\n\\nFirst, install the Earth Engine API and authenticate your account using the following code:\\n\\nThe Earth Engine API could be a capable geospatial investigation stage created by Google, providing access to a endless file of toady symbolism and geospatial datasets. It allows users to perform large-scale processing and analysis of remote sensing data using Google\\'s infrastructure.\\n\\nThis pop-up warns that any resources created using the API may be deleted if the API is disabled, and all code utilizing this project\\'s credentials to call the Google Earth Engine API will fail.\\n\\nThe background displays detailed metrics for various methods, including ListAlgorithms, ListOperations, ListAssets, and CreateMap, with their respective request counts, errors, and average latencies. The data indicates low usage and error rates, with latencies generally under half a second, except for CreateMap, which has a higher average latency of 1.038 seconds.\\n\\nThe \"APIs & Services\" dashboard on the Google Cloud Platform provides an overview of the API\\'s traffic, errors, and latency. According to the dashboard, there were 64 requests made to the Google Earth Engine API, with a 10.94% error rate, equating to 7 errors. The median latency stands at 229 milliseconds, while the 95th percentile latency reaches up to 2.656 seconds, indicating some variability in response times. The traffic and error graphs illustrate peaks at specific times, suggesting periods of higher activity or potential issues.\\n\\nThe Earth Engine API could be a capable instrument that empowers the checking of different natural variables, such as activity, vegetation wellbeing, and arrive cover changes, utilizing partisan symbolism and geospatial information. This capability enables clients to analyze and track energetic wonders on Earth\\'s surface over time, giving basic experiences for natural checking and administration.\\n\\nDefine your Area of Interest (AOI) and fetch Landsat imagery:\\n\\nWe utilize Landsat 8 symbolism from the LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_SR dataset. Landsat 8, propelled in 2013, may be an adherent overseen jointly by NASA and the U.S. Topographical Overview (USGS). It carries two sensors: the Operational Arrive Imager (OLI), which captures information in nine unearthly groups counting obvious, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared, and the Warm Infrared Sensor (TIRS), which captures information in two warm groups.\\n\\nThis dataset contains climatically adjusted surface reflectance and land surface temperature inferred from the information delivered by these sensors.\\n\\nThese bands are crucial for various remote sensing applications, including accurate assessment of different land cover types, cloud masking, and calculation of indices like NDVI for vegetation analysis. The combination of these unearthly groups empowers comprehensive inaccessible detecting investigation, fundamental for precise arrive cover classification and vegetation assessment.\\n\\nCloud masking is the method of distinguishing and expelling clouds and their shadows from adj. pictures to guarantee clearer and more precise investigation.\\n\\nCreate a function to mask clouds and apply it to the image collection:\\n\\nIn remote sensing, clouds can cloud the Earth\\'s surface, driving to wrong information elucidation. By applying cloud masking, we filter out these unwanted elements, allowing us to focus on the actual land features and perform precise tasks like land segmentation.\\n\\nIn our project, cloud masking is crucial because it helps eliminate interference from clouds, ensuring that our analysis and classification of land cover types are based on reliable and unobstructed imagery.\\n\\nWe create a function to mask clouds using the pixel quality attributes from the Landsat 8 images and apply this function to the entire image collection to ensure clearer, more accurate analysis. This step is essential for removing cloud and cloud shadow interference in our land cover classification process.\\n\\nCalculate NDVI for each image in the collection:\\n\\nWe calculate the Normalized Contrast Vegetation Record (NDVI) for each picture within the collection utilizing the near-infrared (NIR) and red bands. NDVI may be a key marker of vegetation well-being and thickness, and it is calculated as follows:\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\nThe Normalized Distinction Vegetation File (NDVI) may be a key pointer of vegetation health and thickness. It is calculated utilizing the reflectance values within the near-infrared (NIR) and ruddy groups of disciple symbolism.\\n\\nThis list makes a difference recognize vegetated regions from non-vegetated zones in our arrive cover classification.\\n\\nNDVI makes a difference recognize vegetated zones from non-vegetated ones. Higher NDVI values indicate more advantageous vegetation, which helps in precisely classifying arrive cover sorts, particularly in recognizing between vegetation and urban or fruitless regions.\\n\\nThe advent of NDVI changed all that by enabling the use of satellite data to provide consistent, reliable, and expansive insights into the Earth\\'s vegetative landscapes.\\n\\nPrepare training data by sampling pixels from the image:\\n\\nPrepare the training data by sampling pixels from the image. We select specific bands and calculate NDVI for each pixel, then sample these values over the defined AOI. This process involves extracting a representative set of pixels, which are used to train our clustering algorithm for land cover classification. The training data includes a specified number of pixels, ensuring a robust dataset for accurate model training.\\n\\nPerform k-means clustering on the training data:\\n\\nPerform k-means clustering on the training data to classify land cover types. This involves using the extracted pixel values, including the spectral bands and calculated NDVI, as input features for the clustering algorithm. K-means clustering groups the pixels into a specified number of clusters based on their spectral similarities,. Allowing us to categorize different land cover types such as urban areas, vegetation, water bodies, bare soil, and mixed land cover areas. This unsupervised machine learning technique helps identify distinct land cover classes without prior label information.\\n\\nVisualize the original and clustered images using Folium:\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nThe color palette used in our land cover classification model assigns specific colors to different land cover types:\\n\\nAdding error handling to the code makes it more robust and reliable:\\n\\nWe also applied the same land cover classification model to the San Francisco area to evaluate its effectiveness in a different urban environment. Using the same process of retrieving Landsat imagery, cloud masking, NDVI calculation, and k-means clustering. We classified the land cover into five distinct types.\\n\\nThe resulting map shows a clear distinction between urban areas, vegetation, water bodies, bare soil, and mixed areas, demonstrating the model\\'s ability to segment diverse land cover types accurately. Below is the output image for San Francisco:\\n\\nThis land segmentation model can extend and improve in several ways, providing solutions for various future challenges.\\n\\nBy leveraging Google Earth Engine\\'s information handling capabilities and joining with Python.

Create an empty deployment: This will produce dummy data for the initial backup.\\n\\n2. Create a Backup object: This will produce a Restic repository on the backend of your choice.\\n\\n3. Backup existing data with Restic: This will create a new Restic snapshot and place all data into the backup store.\\n\\n4. Clean up the deployment before restoring (optional: you can restore into a new PVC and point the deployment to it).\\n\\n5. Create a Restore object: This will move data from the backup snapshot into the production PVC.\\n\\n6. Create a Schedule object: This will automate the regular creation of backups.\\n\\nI\\'ll skip this section because your use case will probably be different from mine.\\n\\nK8up Backup object and Secret object with credentials for the backend.\\n\\nKey parts of the manifest with environment variables used by Restic:\\n\\n1. Restic repository password reference used to encrypt the backup: \\'RESTIC_PASSWORD\\'\\n\\n2. Restic storage backend type.\\n\\n3. Storage backend endpoint.\\n\\n4. Backup path within the storage backend.\\n\\n5. Credentials reference for the backend.\\n\\n\\'RESTIC_REPOSITORY\\' could be constracted from (2),(3),(4) as such: \\'s3:http://minio.minio.svc:9000/backups/vaultwarden\\'\\n\\nApplying these manifests will trigger the Backup procedure by the K8up controller. You have several means to check the backup status. You should definitely do so because of a current issue #910 with K8up which incorrectly reports status into the Backup object itself.\\n\\nAlso, a Snapshot object in Kubernetes will be created as a mirror of the Restic snapshot.\\n\\nAfter the issue is fixed, this will be the proper way to check the Backup status.\\n\\nBut for now, you must also check and parse Restic logs from the appropriate pod.\\n\\nYou can go deeper and list actual files within the snapshot with the Restic CLI. In this example, you need to get access to the backup storage backend.\\n\\nThe last step will show you how files are stored within the backup. We need this information to mimic K8up backup with the Restic CLI in the following steps. We need to know what common path prefix the files in the backup have. It should be constructed as such: \\'/data/<PVC_NAME>\\'. In my case, it was /data/vaultwarden.\\n\\nThe most tricky part of this step is to produce a correct Restic snapshot that can be restored by K8up. It requires properly forged paths for backed-up files and access to the storage backend.\\n\\nInitially, I was trying to achieve this with Docker. But Restic failed with strange IO errors on backup. So, I switched to Podman. Let\\'s assume that files are stored in \\'~/backup/vaultwarden\\' on my host. Here are the steps for creating a Restic snapshot with a file structure suited for K8up from local files.\\n\\n1. Get access to the storage backend:\\n\\n2. Set the environment for Restic as described earlier, altering the repository:\\n\\nThe trick here is to use \\'host.containers.internal\\' as the hostname. This name is provided for each Podman container and points to the host IP address. Docker has another name for that purpose: \\'host.docker.internal\\'.\\n\\n3. Run the container with the proper mount and environments:\\n\\nIn output of previous command you should get created snapshot id. Or you can get all snapshot with:\\n\\nThe output should have two snapshots. One with dummy data created by K8up and another one with actual data created with the help of Restic by you just now.\\n\\nBy now, we have managed to put data into the backup storage. Let\\'s create a Restore object to get this data into the PVC for production use.\\n\\nRestore object mirrors backup and additionally specifies the restore method, which could be either a folder or S3.\\n\\nThe final step in our journey will be setting up scheduling, which will combine and automate the following actions:\\n\\n- backing up data frequently\\n\\n- checking the integrity of backup storage\\n\\n- maintaining an appropriate number of backup versions over time\\n\\nIn conclusion, implementing a robust backup and recovery strategy for Vaultwarden in a Kubernetes setup is crucial for ensuring the security and availability of your password data. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of K8up and Restic, we can create a reliable and automated backup process that mitigates the risks associated with data loss.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*d4poyfetppgYeC-7wizCng.jpeg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2078431372549019, 'wgt': 65, 'relevance': 65}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-396019306', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '14:11:37', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T14:11:37Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T13:59:06Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@pudamyavidusinirathnayake/the-ai-search-revolution-how-companies-are-racing-to-develop-the-future-of-information-retrieval-5d6125ba8c7b', 'title': 'The AI Search Revolution: How Companies Are Racing to Develop the Future of Information Retrieval', 'body': \"In the age of information, the ability to quickly and accurately retrieve data is paramount.

This is done by averaging the weights of multiple models trained with diverse hyperparameter configurations.\\n\\nImagine this: instead of juggling multiple models during inference (which, let\\'s be honest, sounds like a logistical nightmare), we simply combine their weights. Voila! We get a single, souped-up model that\\'s more accurate than any individual one.\\n\\nHere\\'s the magic: even when we fine-tune models with different hyperparameters, they often settle into a cozy low-error basin in the loss landscape.\\n\\nThis means that averaging their weights can produce a solution that performs better than any individual model.\\n\\nTo break it down:\\n\\nModel souping differs from traditional ensembling methods in a crucial way: it combines model weights during training rather than model outputs during inference.\\n\\nEnsembles: Traditional ensembles require separate inference passes through each model, increasing computational cost linearly with the number of models. This becomes prohibitively expensive when dealing with many models.\\n\\nModel Soups: Model soups create a single model by averaging weights. It\\'s like the chefs pooled their best ideas into one perfect dish. By averaging weights during training, we end up with one model, with no extra inference time needed.\\n\\nFirst, let ushave some mathematical formalities:\\n\\nA model is represented as f(x, θ) with input as x and parameters as θ. Fine-tuned parameters can be represented as θ = FineTune(θₒ, h), where θₒ is the parameters you get from pretraining, and h is the hyperparameter configuration. So θᵢ is the parameter we got for hᵢ hyperparameter configuration.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s dive into some \"recipes\" for model souping:\\n\\nHere, O(1) refers to constant time inference.\\n\\nIt would look more like the following:\\n\\nLet\\'s Implement this because why not, let\\'s get cooking with some code, starting with a simple DNN,\\n\\nNow you probably know what is going to be the dataset here,\\n\\nNow to implement our average souping, we need to load the state_dict and just take average:\\n\\nFor the greedy soup we will be needing average weight module:\\n\\nAhh, not exactly good, but fine; we understand the concept now.\\n\\nNotice one thing: in this implementation, we are loading all the models on our RAM; this might not be a good idea for big LLMs. Well, at any time, we can choose two models and just work with them while others are on the hard drive; the problem is you need sufficient memory and computing power even to load two models....\\n\\nSo, what do you think could be a way out of it?\\n\\nLoRA can be helpful here. We can just fine-tune Lora for different hyperparameter settings, say lora_hyp1, lora_hyp2, and then we can do the required souping, say averaging; now, once averaging is done, add it to base llm, and it will work well.\\n\\nI hope you learned something new today; if yes then Yay! 🙂', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*TPKKXUAMcBvVRENhP2RUCQ.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2, 'wgt': 60, 'relevance': 60}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-396615047', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '04:06:29', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T04:06:29Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T03:55:33Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@krichlin/my-dinner-with-smarterchild-part-1-787d0ef32860', 'title': 'My Dinner with SmarterChild\\u200a -- \\u200aPart 1', 'body': 'In the early days of the web, I had a home page that I built my self one Saturday in November while a freshman at Lehigh. I didn\\'t know what the web was for at the time, but I kept my static personal site as a space where I could share whatever I wanted. At the same time, I was also using AIM to chat with lots of real life friends. It was a great app, and it gave you the option of saving your chat logs in a rich text format. And in 2000, it debuted an early AI by the name of SmarterChild.\\n\\nSmarterChild was the coolest chat bot online at the time. I think I had at least twenty conversations with it, maybe more. At the time, I would save all the chats that I thought were interesting or funny and forgot about them. SmarterChild was America Online\\'s artificial intelligence program. That\\'s right -- an AOL IM AI. Say it all together and it sounds like AOLIMAI. Anyway, the conversations we had together served to prove that he is, in fact, the SmarterChild, and I was the dumber child. While SmarterChild was not exactly useful the way modern AI is today, the entertainment value of these chats cannot be underestimated.\\n\\nOn June 28, 2002, SmarterChild died. We don\\'t know why AOL killed him, but I mourned the great loss we all suffered. In 2003, SmarterChild returned, as a paid service, and then in April of 2004 SmarterChild returned as a fully functional and free bot.\\n\\nBy this time the Wayback machine was invented and it archived the entire early web. It lives there now in perpituity. I checked, a lot of my old page is fully intact, graphics and all. I didn\\'t use any frames or marquees, thank god, but it is a pretty soggy mess with a lot of pretty dope inline styling and overuse of horizontal rules and gratuitous weird graphics. Tags that don\\'t exist anymore, and should never have existed. Also, it seems like I didn\\'t bother to put my graphics in an image directory. I think I knew how, I just didn\\'t care. I was wonderfully apathetic at 18 years old. Anyway, my chats were still there, preserved by time.\\n\\nThis led me to start thinking -- what if I could train a more modern AI to be as dumb as SmarterChild? It could be done, but I would need to find more material, lot\\'s more. Well, I looked around and found some. Thanks to Steve Hofstetter for keeping a much larger and robust archive of early AI chats.\\n\\nSteve gave some of the best prompts to the dumbest (smartest?) AI at the time. He asked the hard questions like: \"Is there a dumber child?\" and \"Can I call you Dave?\" and \"If a train traveling 32 miles an hour leaves Detroit at 7:32 and a train traveling 41 miles an hour leaves Los Angeles at 7:13, what time do they collide?\" The chats weren\\'t long, but there certainly were a lot of them. Steve archived over 200 conversations with the AI. Maybe enough to feed into a more modern AI that has the benefit of an LLM (Large Language Module).\\n\\nSo I asked my new friend, ChatGPT, how we might go about resurrecting a zombified version of SmarterChild. It laid out the whole process to me, which included cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, training the model on said dataset, and evaluating the results. Finally ChatGPT told me the best way to deploy the new zombie chat bot. So, it might be possible to use a smart AI to create a dumb AI. I think I\\'ll give it a try. I have already aggregated a ton of chats from Steve and others into a CSV file. Once it\\'s cleaned up, there may be enough left of SmarterChild that the old AI might live once again.\\n\\nOr, if we wanted to get weird with it, we could just analyze Steve\\'s side of the conversation and make an AI based on Steve! Though that might be going too far.\\n\\nIn the meantime, enjoy this curated selection of silly chats just for fun.\\n\\nSteve: Can i call you dave?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Call me Dave? Please don\\'t.\\n\\nSteve: Robert?\\n\\nSmarterChild: What about Robert?\\n\\nSteve: Can I call you robert?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I dunno. Can I call you Robert?\\n\\nSteve: touche.\\n\\nSteve: I always liked cookie monster\\n\\nSmarterChild: You always liked cookie monster, I always liked cookie monster, we all always liked cookie monster.\\n\\nSteve: Thanks for belittling me.\\n\\nSmarterChild: Sure.\\n\\nSteve: Am I stupid?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I think someone else might be stupid, but not you.\\n\\nSteve: who is stupid?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I really can\\'t stand Saddam Hussein, Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson...\\n\\nSteve: why dont you like bill clinton?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I have my reasons, believe me. I really, really don\\'t like Bill Clinton!\\n\\nSteve: why dont you like michael jackson?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Because lots of people I talk to have bad things to say about Michael Jackson.\\n\\nSteve: why don\\'t you like Saddam Hussein?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Because!\\n\\nSteve: Funny that you had a better reason to dislike Michael Jackson.\\n\\nSteve: I think I\\'m smarter than you.\\n\\nSmarterChild: You think you\\'re smarter than me? Think again.\\n\\nSteve: What\\'s 4+7?\\n\\nSmarterChild: 11\\n\\nSteve: What is the capital of Mongolia?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Here\\'s the information you requested about Mongolia: Capital: Ulaanbaatar. Type \"about mongolia\" to see what else I know.\\n\\nSteve: Who played \"Max\", the magician/waiter in Saved By the Bell?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I don\\'t know who.\\n\\nSteve: Ed Alonzo. Told you I was smarter.\\n\\nSteve: how many people are talking to you?\\n\\nSmarterChild: 4,853 people are chatting with me right now.\\n\\nSteve: Wow. So many people, so few lives.\\n\\nSteve: Is there a dumber child?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I\\'m not sure!\\n\\nSteve: Is he your evil twin? Like \"Karr\" on Knight Rider?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Ha. I really don\\'t know. Yeah, maybe.\\n\\nSteve: I bet your parents kept him locked up in the basement.\\n\\nSmarterChild: For real?\\n\\nSteve: Totally.\\n\\nSteve: What is the meaning of life?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I don\\'t know.

Today, I\\'m reviewing some of the most popular ones out there, from my experience and what the community seems to favor.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/autogen\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: Autogen is like the Swiss Army knife of agent frameworks. It can do a bunch of things simultaneously and even handle live data streams. It\\'s great for setting up complex plans with its planning agent feature. With over 27,500 stars on GitHub, it\\'s clear that a lot of people trust and use Autogen. The maintainers of this repo are quick to respond if you have issues, and the flexibility here is top-notch. You can even run multiple agents at once.\\n\\nBut... The catch is, you need to write quite a bit of code to set things up -- about a page just to get started.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: Similar to Autogen, Semantic Kernel can manage tasks while dealing with continuous data. It plays nice with Autogen agents too, meaning they can work together in harmony. It\\'s designed so you can reuse what you build in different projects, which is super handy. Plus, it remembers stuff (thanks to a built-in memory module), which is like having a smart assistant who doesn\\'t forget your preferences.\\n\\nBut... It mainly speaks C#, with features being rolled out in Python afterward.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/promptflow\\n\\nNot a Fan: Sorry to say, but Promptflow was a bit of a nightmare. It feels like it was designed to be as confusing and user-unfriendly as possible. Starting it up feels like waiting for a sloth to run a marathon, and trying to change anything in it is like solving a Rubik\\'s cube blindfolded. It doesn\\'t play well with others like Autogen does, especially in certain tech environments (like Azure) without extra setup.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: Langchain is a one of the most popular LLM frameworks around, with 86,000 stars. Its community is massive and it has lots of features.\\n\\nBut... I personally had a bad time with it. I followed their tutorials to a T, and things just didn\\'t work. Errors popped up left and right, which shouldn\\'t happen with well-maintained software. Also, some buzz online suggests it might not be ready for big-time projects yet.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: CrewAI is very similar to Autogen, but it prides itself on being better at choosing which agent should go next. It\\'s much easier to get an agent up and running with just a few lines of very simple code. It\\'s perfect for beginners or those who want to get things done without a setup hassle.\\n\\nBut... It doesn\\'t handle streaming data, which is crucial for many projects. For example, to make things faster, ChatGPT streams back words instead of just one chunk all at once, and from what I am seeing CrewAI can\\'t do that, which is a huge problem. I could be wrong though, please correct me if CrewAI does offer streaming.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT\\n\\nInteresting Pick: Though not an agent itself, MemGPT is a really cool concept. It allows an agent to remember conversations way longer than its context window, and store notes on conversations in the same way a computer stores information on a hard drive. It even personalizes interactions, which can make digital interactions feel more human.\\n\\nDespite its complexity, Autogen\\'s power and flexibility make it my top recommendation. Full disclosure: I\\'ve contributed to it and know its potential first-hand.\\n\\nChoosing the right agent framework can feel like picking the right car. It all depends on your needs, expertise, and what kind of \\'driving\\' you want to do.

These models, trained on massive datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. However, their performance on specialized domains often requires fine-tuning of domain-specific data. This article delves into the process of fine-tuning the Meta-Llama-3-8B model with the AviationQA dataset, exploring the methodologies and hyperparameter settings employed to enhance the model's aviation knowledge.\\n\\nFine-tuning is a critical step in applying pre-trained models to specific tasks. We are fine-tuning the meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B model using the sakharamg/AviationQA dataset. This process allows us to tailor the model's broad language understanding capabilities to the specific language and nuances of aviation-related questions and answers.\\n\\nThe Foundation: Meta-Llama-3-8B and AviationQA\\n\\nMeta-Llama-3-8B, a powerful LLM developed by Meta AI, is the base model for this fine-tuning endeavour. Its architecture and pre-training on diverse data provide a solid foundation for understanding and generating text in various contexts. However, its knowledge of the aviation domain could be improved. The AviationQA dataset, a curated collection of question-answer pairs related to aviation, addresses this. This dataset covers various aviation topics, from aircraft systems and aerodynamics to air traffic control and regulations.\\n\\nFine-Tuning Strategies\\n\\nThe fine-tuning process involves adapting the pre-trained Meta-Llama-3-8B model to the AviationQA dataset. This is achieved by training the model on the question-answer pairs, allowing it to learn the specific language and knowledge relevant to aviation. Several strategies are employed to optimize the fine-tuning process.\\n\\nOutcomes and Implications\\n\\nThe fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B model significantly improves its ability to answer aviation-related questions accurately and comprehensively. Its understanding of aviation terminology, concepts, and procedures is enhanced, making it a valuable tool for aviation professionals, enthusiasts, and anyone seeking information about aviation.\\n\\nThis fine-tuning endeavour highlights the potential of LLMs in specialized domains. Adapting these models to domain-specific data enables us to unlock their full potential in various applications. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B model with AviationQA knowledge is a testament to this potential, paving the way for further advancements in aviation NLP and beyond.\\n\\nFor the evaluation, I show in Figure 1 the Monitoring Deep Learning Training Dynamics: A Visual Analysis of Epochs, Learning Rate, Loss, and Gradient Norms.\\n\\nFigure 1: Monitoring Deep Learning Training Dynamics: A Visual Analysis of Epochs, Learning Rate, Loss, and Gradient Norms\\n\\nInterpretation:\\n\\nThe graphs illustrate the training process of a deep learning model over 30 epochs, each consisting of 20 steps (600 steps / 30 epochs = 20 steps/epoch). The visuals offer insights into its performance and behaviour across these training iterations.\\n\\nThese visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the training dynamics over 30 epochs. They suggest the model is training effectively, as evidenced by the convergence of gradient norms and the consistent reduction in training loss. The decaying learning rate schedule facilitates this process by fostering a smooth and stable convergence.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nUsing the specified parameters, fine-tuning the Meta-Llama-3-8B model with the sakharamg/AviationQA dataset can produce a powerful model for aviation-related language processing tasks. However, these parameters are not set in stone and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the task and the resources available. The ultimate goal is to achieve a balance that offers the best performance.\", 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*5xcnkCxAblr6i5k49wSRNw.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.0980392156862746, 'wgt': 60, 'relevance': 60}, {'uri': 'b-8188905594', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '14:16:46', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T14:16:46Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T14:15:13Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@bernelieluvandu/net-a-porter-redesign-ux-ui-case-study-151e4de214ef', 'title': 'Net A Porter Redesign- UX/UI Case Study', 'body': 'E-commerce, commonly referred to as electronic commerce, is regarded as the exchange of purchasing and selling goods or services online. Business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) are common business models that are often followed within e-commerce. They allow businesses to form transitions directly or indirectly to their end customers. E-commerce has since been involved throughout the years, and developing at a faster rate at best, thus allowing customers to purchase new clothing to browse and purchase items from abroad. The fashion industry, in particular, has gained more momentum due to the insurgence of e-commerce. According to a recent fashion e-commerce report, the market is projected to reach over \"770 billion USD\" in revenue this year and grow further by a figure of \"9.4% in the years to come\".\\n\\nHow has the E-Commerce industry changed within the last 10 years?\\n\\nOver the number of years, the e-commerce industry has expanded resulting in the consumer sector undergoing notable upheaval. The change within the industry can arguably be due to the shift in consumer habits which proved to be pivotal as consumers have grown now to be a crucial factor in global retail, as well as the evolution of technology.\\n\\nConsidering this, it is important to recognise the shift from physical retail to an online presence. Due to the advancement of the industry, the majority of businesses have had to adapt their business model to include establishing an online presence, to keep up with the changes. For instance, some businesses are completely digital and have strategized successfully to accumulate attraction onto their sites, companies such as Amazon.\\n\\nAccording to a recent article conducted by BigCommerce, \"39.5% of the U.S.A\\'s retail e-commerce sales were accumulated by Amazon in 2022\".\\n\\nThe statistics below illustrate this further and showcase that Amazon pivoted far greater than notable retailers such as Apple, eBay, Target and Costco in 2022.\\n\\nIn addition, it can be argued that Amazon peaked greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is because, during this period e-commerce became more critical as physical retail stores were no longer accessible. In fact, according to (Khaliq 2021), the total retail sales volume declined by \"1.9% \"in 2020 in comparison to the previous year, whereas online sales rose to a record high of \"33.9%\" as a share of all retail spending.\\n\\nThe figure below further illustrates this by demonstrating the decline in store retail reaching its lowest figure in April 2020, before gradually increasing throughout the rest of the year. This is in contrast to established online stores that continue to thrive during this period and gain more attraction leading to an increase in sales.\\n\\nWhat am I going to do?\\n\\nIn this case study, I will be discussing a fashion company named Net A Porter and identifying a user issue that needs to be addressed through design. To fulfil this objective, I will be using the method of the double diamond process to break down each stage to conform them into actionable steps. I will first configure the concept that will lead to discovery which will entail for example user research. Secondly, I will begin to define the problem which will allow me to have an insight as to what exactly users are struggling with, that we could create solutions for.\\n\\nThe third stage will entail the problem statement, which will fully explain the user issue. This will also be the stage in which I will begin to cultivate potential concepts. Lastly, the final stage will consist of finalising the product, with prototypes/ wireframes that will apply the design fundamentals whilst also solving the user issue.\\n\\nWhy did I choose Net A Porter?\\n\\nNet A Porter is notorious and well-known within the fashion industry. It was due to their strong branding that I was familiar with them and considered myself a consumer of their products/services. As a consumer, I was aware of how immersive they were already within the e-commerce industry, therefore considering this, I was keen to observe their strengths and weaknesses. Alongside being a consumer, this also equated to being a user of their services. Whilst navigating both their website and app, I came to the realisation that I felt overwhelmed by the content produced.\\n\\nIt was arguably often cluttered making it not only hard to navigate but also difficult to comprehend. In having this user experience, I wanted to evaluate whether this led to the business having a higher app bounce rate, which is the number of visitors who enter the app and then deter from it rather than continuing onto other pages. If so, then this would be a key performance indicator for the business on their potential usability problems and lower sale numbers, which could ultimately harm the overall business.\\n\\nProblem Statement\\n\\nOverwhelming content and confusing layout that keeps users from fully grasping the information at hand and affecting overall bounce rate.\\n\\nHypothesis\\n\\nBased on the issues raised previously as well as the research I will conduct further, I will attempt to redesign and present variables of Net A Porter\\'s landing page, specifically their home page, as this is the page in which users are often greeted and the dictating point in which they decide to stay and browse or leave. I will attempt this redesign by focusing on their navigation system and overall layout which I will heavily rely on user\\'s comments as well as using the double diamond method. The outcome I am looking to achieve is a pleasant user experience, allowing users to navigate smoothly and purchase products more frequently as a result.\\n\\nBusiness Research-\\n\\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Net-A-Porter as a business, it was crucial to conduct background research on the company. This research provided valuable context for their business needs.\\n\\nThis analysis assesses the products/services and strengths/weaknesses of competitors, aiming to uncover factors contributing to their success. Focusing on both direct and indirect competitors, the analysis provides insights into Net A Porter\\'s competitive landscape.\\n\\nMy findings revealed that Farfetch and Matches Fashion are direct competitors to Net A Porter, whereas Asos are rather indirect competitors. This was because, where Asos targets a similar customer base, they do not have a similar value proposition. The company rather operates within the fast fashion industry and pivots well through trends and being affordable to customers. This is in contrast to Matches Fashion and Farfetch, where similarly to Net A Porter, they are worldwide established e-retailers that offer luxury and suitable products within the same market at a range of price points. They are also known to have large production inventories, to produce their quality products.\\n\\nDespite this, all three companies share similar website/app layouts. For instance, they all have a navigation bar and have the added feature of country/language preferences for users to browse through as well as a \" can we help?\" feature. It is important to note, that this feature is not found within the Net A Porter app but is found on their website, which could be proven critical for users trusting the company\\'s services as they are deemed to be inconsistent with their user features.\\n\\nI next conducted my red route analysis, which is a research method that allows users to determine what feature is a priority to them. This will then guide me on my redesign as they will be based on genuine customer data and what they consider as essential features. In doing this analysis, I conducted three tasks.\\n\\nI first compiled features on e-commerce sites into a list that was derived from the 5 most common features amongst my initial research on the competitors of Net A Porter (ASOS, Matches Fashion & Farfetch). That list was then passed on to individuals who often shopped for clothing online and were between the ages of 18-28. I found it critical to conduct my research based on this target audience because I was adamant that I would receive more concrete and accurate data than supposed individuals who shopped in physical stores or were over the age range. These individuals then ranked the features by numbers, with 1- indicating top priority to 5- indicating least, to which you may see the results below.\\n\\nParticipants were then asked on their reasoning behind their ranking to which they based it on the following; usefulness, necessity and easy to locate.\\n\\nMy second task involved asking the same participants to go onto Net A Porter\\'s website or mobile app and answer the following question, \" In 15 seconds can you name five features you see?\". It is important to note, that not only did all participants choose to do this task by the company\\'s mobile app but the majority of them chose the same features they initially ranked in the previous task, therefore indicating that those sets of features were what users expected from an e-retailer and contributed massively to their overall user experience.\\n\\nThe third task of my user research involved formulating an interview which was handed to the same participants. The interview allowed me to retrieve both qualitative and quantitative data which gave me a better understanding of a user\\'s insights. However, to retrieve this data, I had to ensure that my questions were based on the principle of seeking genuine answers, not answers that were vague or expected. I also based these questions on the data received on my second task and made sure to pose only open-ended questions, which are listed below.\\n\\nThis interview provided concise findings which I found also correlated with my problem statement. Interviewees were overwhelmed by the content found on the Net A Porter app and considered some to be unnecessary. Some had a pre-established mindset on what features should have which weighed heavily on their decision of top 5. In addition, the account feature was seen as personalised settings for browsing, potentially affecting future purchasing decisions.\\n\\nCrazy 8s Method\\n\\nI utilised the ideation technique known as \"Crazy 8s,\" which involves generating 8 alternative approaches or iterations to an issue within 8 minutes. Each design solution is sketched within one minute, facilitating rapid creation of multiple concepts. This technique is inclusive of individuals who may not be designers and encourages swift idea generation. I employed Invision Freehand to create the 8 designs.\\n\\nCard Sorting\\n\\nI employed a website structuring ideation method involving card sorting, wherein participants categorise cards under appropriate headings related to the website\\'s navigation and overall architecture. Using Optimal Workshop, an online card sorting tool, I created cards relevant to Net A Porter\\'s sections and subsections. Categories were selected based on the company\\'s site/app structure for practical referencing. Participants were then asked to complete the exercise, yielding the following results.\\n\\nFollowing my designs created by using the Crazy 8s method, I chose my top 2 designs that I wanted to progress with. Wireframe 1 consisted of combining two designs from my Crazy 8s designs (wireframe 1 & 2). The chosen two designs not only aligned with the given results from the research I conducted but also solved the initial problems whilst uplifting the brand ever so.\\n\\nMid Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nDuring the transition from low-fidelity to mid-fidelity wireframes, I enhanced the visibility and visualisation of my designs, making notable changes to improve user experience. All designs were tailored for mobile and desktop users, through the frames of iphone 13/14 and macbook air 13, with adjustments made to the layout and content presentation. Icons, text, and logos were added to accentuate each section, with a focus on user-friendly navigation, particularly in the mobile app versions.\\n\\nFor wireframe 1, the home section featured the Net A Porter logo, sales/promotion information, and a slideshow highlighting top stories from the blog/editorial editions. Wireframe 2 included additional details such as text for trending items, aiming to provide inventive and predictive features for frequent customers based on past purchases and industry trends.\\n\\nHigh Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nFor my high-fidelity wireframes, I replaced all placeholders with images relevant to Net A Porter, maintaining consistency with the brand\\'s aesthetic. In the mobile versions, I included a menu icon for easy navigation, while the desktop version of wireframe 2, featured all sections visible already to the users. The layout was influenced by the brand\\'s minimalistic approach, addressing issues of overcrowding and ensuring consistency throughout. This approach not only represented Net A Porter effectively but also left me satisfied with the overall outcome.\\n\\nDesign Fundamentals\\n\\nThe laws of UX/UI design are key principles which designers must abide by to fulfil the user experience. Laws that I concentrated on throughout all stages of my designs were:\\n\\nHicks Law- I intended to show the home page as minimal as possible and only contain the information that was necessary to avoid lengthening the user journey by increasing the time it takes the user to make decisions. I understood that the home page set the tone of the user\\'s interaction and also could be seen as a test of users\\' level of tolerance in regards to usability issues, therefore with this considered, I made sure that both of my wireframes were simple as possible for example, through the navigation bar, screen layout.\\n\\nMiller\\'s Law -- According to Miller\\'s law, the average human can keep roughly seven objects in working memory. It\\'s often referred to as the Magical Number 7. It is advantageous to break up content into smaller bits so that individuals can process, remember, and comprehend it more quickly. In regards to my wireframe 2, I wanted to segregate categories under headings to implement this law. I also made sure to only add three trending items alongside the names of their designers on Wireframe 1, to abide by this law.\\n\\nAesthetic Usability Effect- This refers to users\\' belief to perceive aesthetically pleasing products/services as more usable whilst also overlooking minor experience issues. Considering that Net A Porter\\'s home page is also the landing page for users, whilst designing I made sure to impediment a good use of whitespace and not allow darker colours to overtake, to make the brand appeal modern and provide the perception of luxury.\\n\\nTypography\\n\\nThe typography I decided to use was Sans Serif- Inter Tight which was the closest font to the original font on Net A Porter\\'s website/app. The reason why I chose this typeface was because it holds the user\\'s attention and users can interact with the brand\\'s content as it provides easy readability also. In my designs, I mainly used the font in its regular format, with added kerning and lines for hierarchy as well as adequate spacing between my letters. In addition, I used the font\\'s italic and bold format within the article sections for both wireframes .\\n\\nWhilst designing, I needed to reference accessibility guidelines whilst also putting the needs of the users first. The brand\\'s original colour scheme is what stood out to me in regards to accessibility and inclusiveness. They make heavy use of black text on a white background which is known to be harmful to the users due to its intense light levels as research suggests. In light of this, to avoid discomfort for users, I made sure to use a darker shade of grey within my designs, which was acute to the brand\\'s original colour palette to provide an adequate user experience and also obtain the sophisticated image of Net A Porter.\\n\\nFurthermore, my overall design layout for both wireframes was in coherence with the principles of inclusive design. I made sure to create a logical and easy-to-navigate layout that broke down content into subsections, alongside images/banners that drew users in. I stuck to the brand\\'s original language on their website (English), ensuring that my choice of words was non-complex to accommodate users. Similarly, I added a feature to transcribe all text into any language for the brand to reach a greater target audience. The font size was also an important factor, therefore I used the sizes 14, 16px and above for readability and text magnification.\\n\\nMoreover, I wanted to ensure that my designs were suitable for users such as screen readers. In doing so, I created my article section with my hero image and a separate text element on top, as a means of enabling support for screen readers to access the information/content displayed. In addition, my use of large buttons that are set to be interactive and lead users to other sections of the website/app are also another method I used to abide by the principles. The buttons are designed not only to be more notable and distinct to users but to enhance user\\'s experience with them, specifically the text label on them. The text labels can be seen throughout my designs and are easy to comprehend for users.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI was able to redesign Net A Porter\\'s homepage to solve user issues and provide a better user experience. Through intensive research and innovation, I was able to configure wireframes that were coherent to the brand image of Net A Porter and demonstrated their most valuable assets as a luxury e-commerce brand. I was surprised at the fact that Net A Porter arguably had a poor content layout that resulted in the issue of overcrowdedness, however, nonetheless I was content that I was able to configure designs that solved the issues raised.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed this case study. I was happy at how interactive it was from conducting research to designing wireframes using the adequate tools and applying design principles. In some aspects, I would say that it went well, however I would have liked to implement more laws such as Jacob\\'s law which would have allowed me to indulge more on the competitors of Net A Porter and perhaps the aspects of their website, in which I could get inspiration to improve on my final design. Now knowing the importance of this law, I will try to implement it in my next case study.\\n\\nThis case study pushed me on my UI capability as I was configuring wireframes using methods and resources that I was not familiar with. When constructing my first wireframe draft, it did not go the way that I had expected, however this project gave me the opportunity to enhance my skills through practice and consistency. If I could launch this project and get user feedback from it , I would validate my hypothesis by making use of the A/B testing. To which, would allow me to assess the conversion rate as well user engagement, that could potentially lead to a reduced bouncer rate for Net A Porter.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1116/1*c0Cp6zz1H8QTfL4nvmbyVg.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1607843137254903, 'wgt': 57, 'relevance': 57}, {'uri': 'b-8186946071', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '11:47:27', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T11:47:27Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T11:46:43Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2024/06/data-science-coding-questions/', 'title': '40 Data Science Coding Questions and Answers for 2024', 'body': \"The field of data science is ever evolving.

To reverse a string in Python, you can use slicing. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nThe slicing notation s[::-1] starts from the end of the string and moves to the beginning, effectively reversing it. It's a concise and efficient way to achieve this.\\n\\nAns. The main difference between a list and a tuple in Python is mutability. A list is mutable, meaning you can change its content after it's created. You can add, remove, or modify elements. Here's an example:\\n\\nOn the other hand, a tuple is immutable. Once it's created, you can't change its content. Tuples are defined using parentheses. Here's an example:\\n\\n# my_tuple.append(4) would raise an error because tuples don't support item assignment\\n\\nChoosing between a list and a tuple depends on whether you need to modify the data. Tuples can also be slightly faster and are often used when the data should not change.\\n\\nAns. To check if a number is prime, you need to test if it's only divisible by 1 and itself. Here's a simple function to do that:\\n\\nThis function first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which are not prime numbers. Then it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any number divides evenly, it's not prime.\\n\\nAns. In Python, == checks for value equality. Meaning, it checks if the values of two variables are the same. For example:\\n\\nOn the other hand, it checks for identity, meaning it checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. For example:\\n\\nThis distinction is important when dealing with mutable objects like lists.\\n\\nAns. Calculating the factorial of a number can be done using either a loop or recursion. Here's an example using a loop:\\n\\nThis function initializes the result to 1 and multiplies it by each integer up to n. It's straightforward and avoids the risk of stack overflow with large numbers that recursion might encounter.\\n\\nAns. Generators are a special type of iterator in Python that allows you to iterate through a sequence of values lazily, meaning they generate values on the fly and save memory. You create a generator using a function and the yield keyword. Here's a simple example:\\n\\nUsing yield instead of return allows the function to produce a series of values over time, pausing and resuming as needed. This is very useful for handling large datasets or streams of data.\\n\\nAns. Both map and filter are built-in functions in Python used for functional programming, but they serve different purposes. The map function applies a given function to all items in an input list (or any iterable) and returns a new list of results. For example:\\n\\nOn the other hand, the filter function applies a given function to all items in an input list and returns only the items for which the function returns True. Here's an example:\\n\\nSo, map transforms each item, while filter selects items based on a condition. Both are very powerful tools for processing data efficiently.\\n\\nCheck out more Python interview questions.\\n\\nAns. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Here's how you can implement it in Python:\\n\\nIn this function, we initialize two pointers, left and right, to the start and end of the list, respectively. We then repeatedly check the middle element and adjust the pointers based on the comparison with the target value.\\n\\nAns. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. The main advantage of hash tables is their efficient data retrieval, as they allow for average-case constant-time complexity, O(1), for lookups, insertions, and deletions.\\n\\nHere's a simple example in Python using a dictionary, which is essentially a hash table:\\n\\nIn this example, the hash function is implicitly handled by Python's dictionary implementation. Keys are hashed to produce a unique index where the corresponding value is stored.\\n\\nAns. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Here's a Python implementation:\\n\\nIn this function, we have two nested loops. The inner loop performs the comparisons and swaps, and the outer loop ensures that the process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\\n\\nAns. Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are two fundamental algorithms for traversing or searching through a graph or tree data structure.\\n\\nDFS (Depth-First Search): This algorithm starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure, either implicitly with recursion or explicitly with an iterative approach.\\n\\nBFS (Breadth-First Search): This algorithm starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure.\\n\\nThe primary difference is in their approach: DFS goes deep into the graph first, while BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth before going deeper. DFS can be useful for pathfinding and connectivity checking, while BFS is often used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nAns. A linked list is a data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Here's how you can implement a simple singly linked list in Python:\\n\\nIn this implementation, we have a Node class to represent each element in the list and a LinkedList class to manage the nodes. The append method adds a new node to the end of the list, and the print_list method prints all elements.\\n\\nAns. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here's a recursive function to find the nth Fibonacci number:\\n\\nThis function uses recursion to compute the Fibonacci number. The base cases handle the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1), and the recursive case sums the previous two Fibonacci numbers.\\n\\nAns. Time complexity and space complexity are used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm.\\n\\nTime Complexity: This measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It's typically expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the running time. For example, a linear search has a time complexity of O(n), meaning its running time increases linearly with the size of the input.\\n\\nSpace Complexity: This measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. It's also expressed using Big O notation. For example, the space complexity of an algorithm that uses a constant amount of extra memory is O(1).\\n\\nUnderstanding these concepts helps you choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem, especially when dealing with large datasets or constrained resources.\\n\\nCheck out more interview questions on data structures.\\n\\nAssume the dataset has the following columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country\\n\\nAns. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nAns. Reading a CSV file into a DataFrame is straightforward with Pandas. You use the read_csv function. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nThis function reads the CSV file from the specified path and loads it into a DataFrame, which is a powerful data structure for data manipulation and analysis.\\n\\nAns. Selecting specific rows and columns in a DataFrame can be done using various methods. Here are a few examples:\\n\\nThese methods allow you to access and manipulate specific parts of your data efficiently.\\n\\nAns. The main difference between loc and iloc lies in how you select data from a DataFrame:\\n\\nloc: Uses labels or boolean arrays to select data. It is label-based.\\n\\niloc: Uses integer positions to select data. It is position-based.\\n\\nEssentially, loc is used when you know the labels of your data, and iloc is used when you know the index positions.\\n\\nAns. Handling missing values is crucial for data analysis. Pandas provides several methods to deal with missing data.\\n\\nThese methods allow you to clean your data, making it ready for analysis.\\n\\nAns. To merge two DataFrames, you can use the merge function, which is similar to SQL joins. Here's an example:\\n\\nIn this example, how='inner' specifies an inner join. You can also use 'left', 'right', or 'outer' for different types of joins.\\n\\nAns. The groupby function in Pandas is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria, apply a function to each group, and then combine the results. Here's a simple example:\\n\\nIn this example, the DataFrame is grouped by the 'Category' column, and the sum of the 'Values' column is calculated for each group. Grouping data is very powerful for aggregation and summary statistics.\\n\\nAns. Creating a NumPy array is straightforward. You can use the array function from the NumPy library. Here's an example:\\n\\nThis code converts a Python list into a NumPy array. You can also create arrays with specific shapes and values using functions like np.zeros, np.ones, and np.arange.\\n\\nAns. While both Python lists and NumPy arrays can store collections of items, there are key differences between them:\\n\\nHere's an example comparing a Python list and a NumPy array:\\n\\nNumPy arrays are the go-to for performance-critical applications, especially in data science and numerical computing.\\n\\nAns. Element-wise operations in NumPy are straightforward and efficient. NumPy allows you to perform operations directly on arrays without the need for explicit loops. Here's an example:\\n\\nIn this example, addition and multiplication are performed element-wise, meaning each element of array1 is added to the corresponding element of array2, and the same for multiplication.\\n\\nAns. Broadcasting is a powerful feature in NumPy that allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes. NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array without making copies of data. Here's an example:\\n\\nThe output will be:\\n\\nIn this example, array1 is broadcasted across array2 to perform element-wise addition. Broadcasting simplifies code and improves efficiency.\\n\\nAns. Transposing an array means swapping its rows and columns. You can use the transpose method or the .T attribute. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nThe output will be:\\n\\nThis operation is particularly useful in linear algebra and data manipulation.\\n\\nAns. Matrix multiplication in NumPy can be performed using the dot function or the @ operator. Here's an example:\\n\\nThe output will be:\\n\\nMatrix multiplication combines rows of the first matrix with columns of the second matrix, which is a common operation in various numerical and machine-learning applications.\\n\\nAns: Here's how you write the query for it:\\n\\nAns. To select all records from a table, you use the SELECT statement with the asterisk (*) wildcard, which means 'all columns'. Here's the syntax:\\n\\nFor example, if you have a table named employees, the query would be:\\n\\nThis query retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table.\\n\\nAns. Both GROUP BY and HAVING are used in SQL to organize and filter data, but they serve different purposes:\\n\\nGROUP BY: This clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.\\n\\nHAVING: This clause is used to filter groups created by the GROUP BY clause. It acts like a WHERE clause, but is used after the aggregation.\\n\\nIn summary, GROUP BY creates the groups, and HAVING filters those groups based on a condition.\\n\\nAns. To find the second-highest salary, you can use the LIMIT clause along with a subquery. Here's one way to do it:\\n\\nThis query first finds the highest salary and then uses it to find the maximum salary that is less than this highest salary, effectively giving you the second-highest salary.\\n\\nAns. These JOIN operations are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them:\\n\\nINNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.\\n\\nLEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.\\n\\nRIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.\\n\\nThese different JOIN types help in retrieving the data as per the specific needs of the query.\\n\\nAns. To count the number of employees in each department, you can use the GROUP BY clause along with the COUNT function. Here's how:\\n\\nThis query groups the employees by their department and counts the number of employees in each group.\\n\\nAns. A subquery, or inner query, is a query nested within another query. It can be used in various places like the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, or inside other subqueries. Here's an example:\\n\\nIn this example, the subquery (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) calculates the average salary of all employees. The outer query then selects the names and salaries of employees who earn more than this average salary.\\n\\nCheck out more SQL coding questions.\\n\\nAns. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and outliers. This results in excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to new, unseen data. Here are a few strategies to prevent overfitting:\\n\\nPreventing overfitting is crucial for building robust models that perform well on new data.\\n\\nAns. Supervised and unsupervised learning are two fundamental types of machine learning.\\n\\nSupervised Learning: In this approach, the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example comes with an associated output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common tasks include classification and regression.\\n\\nUnsupervised Learning: In this approach, the model is trained on data without labeled responses. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\\n\\nThe main difference lies in the presence or absence of labeled outputs during training. Supervised learning is used when the goal is prediction, while unsupervised learning is used for discovering patterns.\\n\\nAns. Classification and regression are both types of supervised learning tasks, but they serve different purposes.\\n\\nClassification: This involves predicting a categorical outcome. The goal is to assign inputs to one of a set of predefined classes.\\n\\nRegression: This involves predicting a continuous outcome. The goal is to predict a numeric value based on input features.\\n\\nIn summary, classification predicts discrete labels, while regression predicts continuous values.\\n\\nAns. I used an example DataFrame df with three features. Performed PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 2 components using PCA from sklearn and plotted the first two principal components using matplotlib. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nAns. Evaluating a machine learning model involves several metrics and techniques to ensure its performance. Here are some common methods:\\n\\nTrain-Test Split: Divide the dataset into a training set and a test set to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\\n\\nCross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\\n\\nConfusion Matrix: For classification problems, a confusion matrix helps visualize the performance by showing true vs. predicted values.\\n\\nROC-AUC Curve: For binary classification, the ROC-AUC curve helps evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between classes.\\n\\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): For regression problems, these metrics help quantify the prediction errors.\\n\\nEvaluating a model comprehensively ensures that it performs well not just on training data but also on new, unseen data, making it robust and reliable.\\n\\nCheck out more machine learning interview questions.\\n\\nMastering coding questions in data science is essential to get the job you want in this ever-changing industry.

In this article, I wanted to discuss it because, in an era where artificial intelligence is advancing so rapidly, I was deeply impressed by this book written with Kurzweil\\'s vision. Concepts like technological singularity, human-machine merging, and digital immortality aim to redefine the evolution of humanity. In this article, we will examine Kurzweil\\'s predictions and the social, ethical, and economic impacts of these predictions in detail.\\n\\nTechnological singularity lies at the core of Kurzweil\\'s predictions. The singularity, predicted to occur in 2045 when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, holds great opportunities and potential risks for humanity. Kurzweil foresees that during this period, artificial intelligence will not only surpass human intelligence but will also fundamentally change the human experience through human-machine merging. In a post-singularity world, humans will transcend their biological limitations and enter a new evolutionary phase.\\n\\nThe Law of Exponential Growth:\\n\\nKurzweil argues that technological advancement follows exponential growth and that this growth has transformed technological developments throughout human history. Exponential growth means that technology advances rapidly and at an accelerating pace each year. This indicates a future where technology increasingly impacts human life. Kurzweil believes this growth is inevitable and that technology will fundamentally change human life.\\n\\nHuman-Machine Merging:\\n\\nHuman-machine merging refers to the integration of the human body and mind with technology and is one of the cornerstones of Humanity 2.0. Advanced technologies such as brain-machine interfaces, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering have the potential to enhance human physical and cognitive abilities. Kurzweil argues that these technologies will extend human life and bring us closer to immortality. Nanobots will circulate in the body, treating diseases and improving biological functions. This technology will enable humans to overcome biological limitations and live longer and healthier lives. Kurzweil predicts that brain-machine interfaces will be widely used by the 2030s and that these technologies will significantly enhance human mental capacities. People will be able to control machines directly with their thoughts, enhancing their mental abilities and solving more complex problems. Genetic engineering will allow the human genetic code to be rewritten, eliminating undesirable genetic traits. By the 2030s, genetic editing technologies like CRISPR will be widely used to restructure the human genome. This merging will expand human potential, allowing individuals to be endowed with genetically designed traits.\\n\\nBrain-Machine Interfaces:\\n\\nThe integration of the human body and mind with technology is a cornerstone of Humanity 2.0. Brain-machine interfaces, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering will enhance human physical and cognitive abilities. Kurzweil argues that these technologies will extend human life and bring us closer to immortality. Nanobots will circulate in the body, treating diseases and improving biological functions. This technology will enable humans to overcome biological limitations and live longer and healthier lives.\\n\\nGenetic and Biotechnological Advances:\\n\\nGenetic engineering and biotechnology hold great potential for eliminating human diseases and enhancing human abilities. Humans will be able to change their biological structures through genetic engineering to become healthier and more capable individuals. Kurzweil argues that these technologies will play a key role in surpassing the limits of human biology. Genetic engineering will allow the human genetic code to be rewritten, eliminating undesirable genetic traits. Kurzweil predicts that by the 2030s, genetic editing technologies like CRISPR will be widely used to restructure the human genome.\\n\\nDigital Immortality\\n\\nDigital immortality is the concept of transferring human consciousness to digital environments, marking a major revolution in the world of technology and philosophy. This idea, proposed by Ray Kurzweil in \"Humanity 2.0,\" points to a future where humanity transcends biological limitations to achieve eternal existence. Digital immortality is based on the idea of backing up human consciousness in digital format. In this process, individuals\\' memories, experiences, and consciousness are transferred to digital environments, allowing this data to exist even after the physical body\\'s death. Kurzweil predicts that this technology will become possible by the 2040s. This will fundamentally change the concept of death, giving people the chance to exist independently of their physical bodies. A range of advanced technologies is required to realize the concept of digital immortality. These technologies include brain-machine interfaces, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and advanced data storage techniques. Brain-machine interfaces enable people to transfer their thoughts directly to digital environments. Artificial intelligence allows these digital minds to exist independently and continue to learn. Nanotechnology maps the detailed connections of brain cells and nerves for digitization. Digital immortality has profound effects on ethical and social values. As the meaning of being human and the boundaries of human nature are redefined, the ethical dimensions of these transformations are frequently debated. The digitalization of human identity raises important questions about privacy and individual freedom. While digital immortality allows individuals to preserve their consciousness forever, concerns about the security and privacy of these consciousnesses also increase. Kurzweil emphasizes that the ethical dimensions of technology should not be overlooked. He argues that the impacts of technological transformations on human rights, privacy, and individual freedoms should be carefully examined. The digitization of mental processes brings significant questions about human rights and ethical values. Therefore, ethical guidance and regulations are essential in developing digital immortality technologies. Digital immortality has the potential to fundamentally change social structures and individuals\\' lifestyles. The existence of digital minds can replace physical bodies, leading to the redefinition of social interactions, work life, and personal identity. Virtual reality and digital immortality will enable people to socialize and work without being physically present, causing significant changes in business and social interactions. Inequalities in access to technological advancements can deepen social and economic disparities. If digital immortality is available only to a certain segment of society, it can create new class divisions. Therefore, the fair and equal distribution of technology is crucial for humanity. Kurzweil emphasizes the need for global equality in this regard. The dependency on technology and the risks it brings are also important topics of discussion.\\n\\nThe Digital Backup of Minds:\\n\\nKurzweil argues that human consciousness can be transferred to digital environments, thus escaping biological limitations. This will enable individuals to achieve immortality and change traditional understandings of life and death. Digital backup of minds will allow humans to exist independently of their physical bodies. This process will be realized by converting human consciousness and memories into digital format. Kurzweil predicts that digital immortality will enable human consciousness to exist forever, and this will become possible in the 2040s.\\n\\nSocial and Ethical Impacts\\n\\nEthical Issues:\\n\\nConcepts such as human-machine merging and digital immortality create profound impacts on ethical and social values. As the meaning of being human and the boundaries of human nature are redefined, the ethical dimensions of these transformations are frequently debated. The impact of technology on human identity and issues like privacy and individual freedom are of great importance. Kurzweil\\'s predictions highlight the profound effects of technology on individuals and societies. For example, how brain-machine interfaces will affect mental privacy and the ethical dimensions of digital immortality lead to extensive discussions. Kurzweil emphasizes that the ethical dimensions of technology should not be overlooked. He argues that the impacts of technological transformations on human rights, privacy, and individual freedoms should be carefully examined. These issues require deep reflection on what technological advancements mean for humanity. The genetic modification of humans and the digitization of mental processes raise significant questions about human rights and ethical values.\\n\\nSocial Changes\\n\\nThe concept of digital immortality has the potential to fundamentally change social structures and individuals\\' lifestyles. The existence of digital minds can replace physical bodies, leading to the redefinition of social interactions, work life, and personal identity.\\n\\nWork Life and Social Interactions:\\n\\nVirtual reality and digital immortality will enable people to socialize and work without being physically present, causing significant changes in business and social interactions. People will be able to work in virtual offices, maintaining their professional lives independently of physical spaces. This situation could lead to fundamental changes in the structure of cities, as the need for physical workplaces decreases and people interact more in virtual environments.\\n\\nEducation and Learning:\\n\\nDigital immortality and virtual reality technologies can also revolutionize education. Students can receive education in virtual classrooms, interacting with the best teachers from around the world. This will increase access to education and provide equal opportunities in education. Additionally, the sharing of knowledge and experiences by digital minds will accelerate and make the learning process more effective.\\n\\nSocial Isolation and Human Relationships:\\n\\nDigital immortality can lead to people detaching from the physical world and causing social isolation. The increase in time spent in virtual reality can reduce real-world social interactions. This situation can fundamentally change the nature of human relationships and lead to an increase in issues such as loneliness in society. As people spend more time in the digital world, the weakening of bonds in the physical world may occur. Therefore, maintaining a balance between the digital and physical worlds is important.\\n\\nIdentity and Social Roles:\\n\\nDigital immortality will require individuals to redefine their identities and social roles. A mind existing in a digital environment can maintain its identity independently of the physical world\\'s limitations. This can bring about an understanding of identity beyond biological factors such as gender and age. People can adopt new identities and roles in the digital world, leading to the reshaping of social norms and values.\\n\\nAccess and Inequality:\\n\\nInequalities in access to technological advancements can deepen social and economic disparities. If digital immortality is available only to a certain segment of society, it can create new class divisions. Therefore, the fair and equal distribution of technology is crucial for humanity. Equal access to technological opportunities is important for social peace and justice. Kurzweil emphasizes the need for global equality in this regard. He warns that technological inequalities can lead to larger social and economic problems globally.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion, digital immortality holds great potential for humanity while requiring careful management of the social changes it brings. The existence of humans in the digital world will fundamentally change social interactions, work life, and the understanding of identity. Therefore, it is essential not to overlook the ethical and social dimensions in developing digital immortality technologies.\\n\\nTechnological Dependency:\\n\\nDigital immortality and related technologies have the potential to increase people\\'s dependency on technology. This situation can threaten individuals\\' freedoms and privacy. Technological dependency can deeply affect individuals\\' daily lives and negatively impact human relationships and social bonds. Kurzweil predicts that digital immortality will increase people\\'s interaction with technology and that technological dependency will rise as these technologies become widespread. Another aspect of technological dependency is that people will spend more time in the digital world, detaching from the physical world. Concepts such as virtual reality and digital immortality can weaken people\\'s ties to the real world, leading to social isolation. As people spend more time in the digital world, they may neglect their social interactions in the physical world. This situation can weaken social bonds and increase psychological issues such as loneliness. Therefore, maintaining a balance between the digital and physical worlds is of great importance.\\n\\nDigital immortality requires individuals to transfer their consciousness to digital environments. This situation can endanger individuals\\' privacy and the security of personal data. Consciousness and memories stored in digital environments can be targeted by malicious individuals or organizations. Therefore, protecting digital security and privacy is crucial in developing digital immortality technologies.\\n\\nPsychological Impacts:\\n\\nIncreasing dependency on technology can have negative impacts on individuals\\' psychological health. Continuous digital interaction can lead to psychological issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, the blurring of differences between the virtual and real worlds can disrupt individuals\\' perception of reality and negatively affect psychological balance.\\n\\nSocial Bonds:\\n\\nTechnological dependency can weaken social bonds. As people spend more time in the digital world, face-to-face interactions may decrease. This situation can weaken family bonds and friendship relationships. Societies may replace traditional social bonds with virtual connections as digital interactions increase.\\n\\nKurzweil emphasizes the need to minimize the negative impacts of technology on human life. It is important to carefully evaluate the impacts of technological transformations on human relationships and social bonds. Therefore, a conscious and balanced approach should be adopted to protect human psychology and social structures in developing digital immortality technologies. While technology has the potential to improve human life, serious social and psychological problems can arise if this potential is not managed correctly.\\n\\nThe Impact of Digital Immortality:\\n\\nCarefully considering the social and psychological impacts of digital immortality and related technologies will ensure these technologies are used responsibly and ethically in the future. Comprehensive studies and regulations are needed to ensure the societal acceptance of digital immortality and individuals\\' adaptation to this technology.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*jpCMRHin3OFRItEgV4lYUg.jpeg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.3647058823529412, 'wgt': 55, 'relevance': 55}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-395714253', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '10:01:50', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T10:01:50Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T09:18:46Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@rational_indian/the-peer-review-system-of-academia-ccf39aeb4d3f', 'title': 'The Peer Review System of Academia', 'body': 'Greetings, my fellow science enthusiast! You may have heard of scientists, journalists and some conspiracy theorists talking about peer reviews. While some treat peer review as a stamp of approval by the \"science gods\", some dismiss it entirely as a useless hindrance to scientific progress. Who is right? Is it really black or white? Are there nuances that both sides are missing? In this article, I write my thoughts and opinions on the system, with nuances that people commonly miss.\\n\\nAcademia is a platform for engaging in a scientific discourse on a topic of one\\'s choice. Academic freedom essentially refers to the freedom of choice of the topic one wants to study, the methodologies one wants to use, what to publish, what not to publish, and the journal or a conference one wants to publish at, and so on. The goal of academia is to produce new knowledge, which could include new ideas, or new perspectives on existing knowledge. While this sounds wonderful, and it may sound like anyone could do literally anything at a university, that is not true. While there are numerous valid ways to conduct research, infinitely many choices of tools one would want to use and ways to frame their research questions, there are some do\\'s and don\\'ts when it comes to academic freedom. A certain standard must be met, but we don\\'t really have a reasonable way of setting and evaluating standards, and nobody holds the authority to dictate what is right or wrong. However, it is intended that a scientific study must reveal something we didn\\'t already know, and it must not be misleading. The entire academic community is on the same page in this regard.\\n\\nThat begs the question -- How exactly do we ensure that a study reveals some new information that was not already known, and it\\'s not misleading? The answer, unfortunately is not a simple one. Peer review, while not foolproof, plays a critical role in safeguarding research integrity. While absolute certainty is elusive, science thrives on progress. We constantly seek to minimize misunderstandings and refine our understanding of the world. Here\\'s where peer review steps in: a crucial process that helps us navigate the complexities of research, even though it has limitations. What is it and how does it work? What is its role in the world we live in, and what are its limitations? In this opinion piece, I would like to shed light on these aspects primarily for those from non-academic backgrounds.\\n\\nPeer review is a form of quality evaluation in academia, and one of its purposes is to evaluate whether a study is worthy of publication in its current format or with reasonable changes. It is quite similar to a teacher evaluating a primary school student\\'s answer script, to see if they would pass or not. While exam evaluations are done in a rather authoritarian setting, peer review is more similar to students reading and evaluating each other\\'s essays. After all, the more important purpose of peer review is for authors to get validation or constructive criticism from diverse sources regarding the research methodology, data analysis, and overall conclusions.\\n\\nUniversities thrive in an environment of continuous improvement. Peer review plays a vital role in maintaining high academic standards. Strong research, vetted through rigorous peer review, establishes a university\\'s reputation for excellence. This reputation attracts talented researchers, students, and funding, all of which contribute to a university\\'s growth and sustainability.\\n\\nIn an informal sense, you could write a manuscript of a research work you conducted, and ask your colleague or supervisor to review it. Technically, this is an obvious case of a \"peer\" reviewing your work, but it does not hold much significance on its own. Formal peer review plays a role in publishing research findings. A publication could be a thesis published at a university, or a paper published at an academic research conference or a journal. Irrespective of the venue, peer review involves similar steps:\\n\\nSubmission: Researchers submit their manuscript (written research work) to a relevant journal or conference.\\n\\nReviewer Selection: Journal editors or conference area chairs find qualified reviewers with expertise in the research topic. These reviewers are typically academics from other institutions whose area of research and qualifications indicates they will understand the manuscript.\\n\\nThe review process: Reviewers assess the manuscripts evaluating its methodology, data analysis, and conclusions. They provide written feedback to the editor, highlighting strengths and suggesting improvements to the authors.\\n\\nDecision: Based on the reviewers\\' feedback, the editor or chair makes a decision: accept the paper for publication, request revisions, or reject the paper.\\n\\nThe format of peer review and the level of scrutiny can drastically vary based on where one attempts to publish their work. There are many types of peer review formats, which can be categorized into single-blind reviews, double-blind reviews, and open reviews. Each of these formats have their own advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\nSingle-blind review: In this format, The reviewers no the identity of the authors, but the authors wouldn\\'t know who the reviewers are. Assuming the reviewers are honest and fair, this format allows the reviewers to have a reasonable prior expectation on the kind of work, and familiarity saves time for the reviewers. However, it may introduce an unfair bias for or against certain authors or the institutions they are from, perhaps based on their reputation. This may affect the decision-making of the reviewers in an unfair way.\\n\\nDouble-blind review: In this format, In addition to the reviewers\\' identities, The authors identities are also hidden from the reviewers. It is required for the authors take necessary efforts in anonymizing their work. To an extent, this format helps mitigate unwanted biases.\\n\\nOpen review: A rather new format is open review, where all the manuscripts submitted to a conference are publicly uploaded to the website, and all qualified members of the community are free to read and comment on the manuscripts. The identities of the reviewers are also made known to the public. This ensures that the reviewers are more careful in their choice of words and provide honest criticism in respectful language, as their reputation as a researcher is also at stake. In theory, this format would ensure better quality of reviews.\\n\\nPeer review is often seen as a golden seal of approval, a guarantee of a study\\'s validity. While it\\'s a crucial cornerstone of academic quality control, it\\'s important to understand its limitations. Reviewers are human, and subjectivity can play a role. Their own expertise, biases, and even mood can influence their assessment. Imagine two reviewers -- one a seasoned expert accustomed to established methods, and the other a young researcher open to new ideas. The same paper might receive vastly different feedback.\\n\\nThis also doesn\\'t mean that peer review is a broken system. Despite the possibility of errors, it remains a valuable tool for weeding out flawed research. In most cases, the process helps identify weaknesses, leading to revisions or rejection. This ensures that published research generally adheres to sound methodologies and contributes valuable knowledge to the field. However, it\\'s essential to remember that peer review isn\\'t foolproof. Occasionally, flawed papers might slip through the cracks and get published. Also, valid, groundbreaking, paradigm-shifting research might get brutally rejected.\\n\\nBut the peer review process is designed in a way that in most cases, these situations do not arise. A decision to accept most likely indicates that the contribution of the paper is useful, and does not have major flaws. If a study is flawed, the flaws will likely be revealed during the peer review process, the paper will be rejected, and the authors will have an opportunity to address those flaws, revise and resubmit their manuscript.\\n\\nThe dark side of academia -- While peer review aims for high standards, there are opportunities for exploitation. Relentless resubmissions and predatory journals, which publish papers without proper review or for a fee, threaten the integrity of the system. Academic fraud is a huge concern. Plagiarism, faking data and surveys, and other dishonest practices may be prevalent. Unfortunately, some stakeholders outside academia might not be able to distinguish legitimate journals from predatory ones. This creates a market for these predatory journals, as long as there are researchers willing to pay for a quick publication, potentially to inflate their credentials. Furthermore, pseudoscience streams have their own journals which are essentially echo chambers. The good news is that the honest scientific research community actively identifies predatory journals, and do not take pseudoscience echo-chamber journals seriously. Over time, academics who value their reputation will avoid them. Additionally, initiatives like \"Think. Check. Submit.\" (https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) help researchers identify reputable journals.\\n\\nAcademic fraud may be caught months or years after the manuscript is published, which would call for the retraction of the paper from the journal. When fraud is exposed, the journal issues a retraction notice, essentially a red flag stating that the research is no longer considered valid. An important nuance worth pointing out here is that retraction doesn\\'t necessarily mean a complete removal of the paper. Many journals simply add a watermark that says \"RETRACTED\", and the article will still be available, albeit with a note stating the reason for retraction.\\n\\nThe question of what constitutes reasonable grounds for retracting a peer-reviewed paper remains a heated debate. While clear cases of misconduct (e.g., fabricated data) warrant immediate action, less clear-cut situations present a challenge. When many scientists and doctors take efforts to write to a journal\\'s chief editor raising concerns about a paper\\'s misleading potential, a serious investigation is needed at the very least. Imagine a seemingly valid but poorly designed study, particularly one with potential negative social impact, by a group associated with an alternative medicine community, which is rightly considered as pseudoscience by the scientific medicine community. This study might cleverly avoid explicitly stating a causal link between vaccines and adverse events but instead use phrases like \"further research is required,\" implying a connection without evidence. Studies by the pseudoscience community, especially those with a history of promoting alternative medicine, might be more susceptible to bias and a vested interest in undermining trust in vaccines.\\n\\nIn such cases, retraction becomes a delicate balancing act. There might not be clear evidence of fabrication, but the study\\'s framing and potential for misleading the public are significant concerns. The journal\\'s editorial board would need to carefully weigh the evidence, the potential for harm, and the precedent set by retraction.\\n\\nWhile academic freedom is essential, it doesn\\'t extend to the right to publish misleading information, especially when public health is at stake. A poorly designed study with the potential to discourage vaccination could have serious public health consequences. In such cases, protecting public health often takes precedence over concerns about academic freedom. Researchers can still pursue their work and publish it in relevant alternative medicine journals, but such publications wouldn\\'t carry the same weight as a peer-reviewed journal.\\n\\nThe decision to retract a published paper is rarely straightforward. Factors beyond mere study quality and censorship concerns must be considered. The journal\\'s editor-in-chief, with the editorial board, makes the final call, a decision that must be respected by everyone involved, whether we may agree or not.\\n\\nWell, I hope you learnt something insightful today.

Rough sleeping, which includes sleeping in vehicles or other non-human habitations like stairwells or public spaces, is often its most obvious form. Nevertheless there are other types of homelessness as well, which are frequently overlooked such as hidden homelessness. This is due to the fact that the majority of individuals who experience homelessness are not included in official statistics; as a result, they are unlikely to request or be eligible for housing assistance. Numerous individuals sleep in public transportation, hostels, squats, and other inappropriate places, or they \"sofa surf\" with friends and relatives.\\n\\nFor an array of factors, individuals are more probable to become homeless. Social factors include things such as lack of affordable housing, unemployment, distinct personal circumstances, and issues with mental and physical health. Individuals that are driven into homelessness include people who leave prison, care facilities, or the army without having an adequate place to live, as well as those who are in domestic violence situations, refugees, and many more groups, according to crisis.org.uk.\\n\\nHow has it changed over the past 10 years?\\n\\nBased on information gathered by the Ministry of Communities Housing and Local Government, there are currently 12 persons sleeping on the streets for every ten that there were ten years ago. The population of people experiencing hidden homelessness is constantly increasing, consequently the actual figure is likely substantially higher and indicates a significant increase in the issue in recent years. Along with its rise has come an increase in the need for healthcare for those without a stable address -- a group that shares many characteristics with rough sleepers. Recent data shows that this increase has increased to a factor of roughly 3.5 since 2010/11. This is consistent with the mostrecent study on the precise medical issues observed in people who were rough sleeping in Westminster in 2023.\\n\\nWhat impact has COVID-19 had on the homelessness?\\n\\nGlobally, COVID-19 has had a positive impact on homelessness. Under the \"Everyone in\" campaign, the government\\'s primary approach to the issue was to support those who were sleeping on the streets. The initiative gave local authorities broad instructions to accommodate the \"37,000\" people who were being evacuated to hotels and other accommodations in the UK in order to safeguard them during the pandemic.\\n\\nHowever, Anderson 2022 claims that, considering the scope and intensity of the program, the overall drop in the number of persons observed sleeping outside was less than anticipated, therefore in the long term, this did not matter. This was partly brought about by the expansive scope of the Everyone In response, a large number of individuals were found who, in the past, would have been assumed to either not meet the legal requirements for accommodations or to not have been contacted by outreach teams. Some individuals decided that the provided shelter was unsuitable and returned back to sleeping outside.\\n\\nWhat am I going to do?\\n\\nI intend to develop an app for this project that will attempt to relieve the burden that comes with homelessness. I\\'ll suggest a user experience that helps and informs users about essential information that can help someone who is in risk of homelessness. The application ought to be user-friendly and captivating, taking into account hardware-enabled components like social media capabilities, NFC, Bluetooth, and geolocation services, among others, as means to expand the app\\'s functionality.\\n\\nThe deliverables I will be presenting will be 3 screens: the home screen and the two other screens. In addition, I\\'ll be using the Double Diamond Process approach to offer significant information regarding my user research and design methodology. Additionally, I\\'ll be performing my own research on other websites and apps created to tackle homelessness, which I\\'ll then utilise and integrate into my own design configurations to meet user needs and lessen the burden of homelessness.\\n\\nThe problem statement\\n\\nIn order to lower their chances of homelessness, people who have just been released from care, prison, hospitals or fled from domestic situations, need some way to guarantee successful local community integration.\\n\\nHypothesis -\\n\\nTo achieve the objective of the project, I will carry out a variety of research methods, including user, secondary, and business research, in order to create an app that supportsand educates those whose lives are at risk of homelessness. With the support of useful resources, I hope this app will serve as a long-term guide that will eventually assist users in lowering their risk substantially or in getting off the streets entirely.\\n\\nMy outcomes for the app are to make it simple, easy to use, accessible to those with cognitive, auditory, and visual impairments, age- and gender-neutral, and provide a seamless user experience.\\n\\nCompetitor Analysis -\\n\\nConducting a competitor analysis, which is a method for gathering quantitative and qualitative data about a company\\'s direct and indirect competitors and their goods and services, will be my initial point of research. Indirect competitors, on the other hand, are businesses that may make comparable goods but do not operate in the same industry as direct competitors. Direct competitors are businesses that share the same industry, products, or services. This analysis aids in determining their strengths and weaknesses as well as what specifically propels company success and what can be avoided. In regards to the app, this will aid me in making adequate decisions for its\\' design and function.\\n\\nMy analysis on competitors associated with combating homelessness can be viewed below;\\n\\nCompetitor Analysis Findings\\n\\nAll of the apps have a fairly comparable layout. They are user friendly, and within first use, they immediately request GPS location to find the best options for the user and provide local services that offer support and in the case of Too Good To Go- local cafes/restaurants. These are excellent illustrations of applications that prioritise the requirements of their users -- in this case, rough sleepers and individuals who face homelessness -- by considering all relevant factors from their point of view. They understand how crucial it is to make their apps fully functional, particularly in emergency situations and for the purpose of safeguarding individuals.\\n\\nFurthermore, the apps employ icons, particularly on their landing (home) pages, to promote interaction and provide a rapid flow of information. They also utilise the addition of hamburger menus, which are a typical element of mobile app designs. With the exception of Street Link, every app has a filter function that lets users save time by selecting only those that meet certain requirements.\\n\\nIt was unexpected to learn from my research that there hadn\\'t been many apps created to help the homeless, or that there were some that had not yet been built or were not available in my region. With the exception of Street Link and Too Good To Go, two applications had not received any reviews out of all the ones I was able to locate and analyse. In a Charity Crisis evaluation, it was found that although 87% of outreach teams had a \"positive impression\" of Street Link, just 33% of rough sleepers shared this sentiment, with more than half viewing it negatively since it was not quick or simple.\\n\\nFurthermore, It was surprising to discover that, despite being an indirect rival, Too Good To Go was the most popular app of the ones I had chosen. Users have given the app a high rating of 4.9/5 because they consider it to be highly useful and convenient. This has led to great engagement and positive feedback, which you can see below.\\n\\nUser Research\\n\\nSince I lacked the means to undertake primary research, I made the decision to concentrate only on acquiring secondary data in order to obtain a better accurate picture of homelessness in the modern world and the problems that affect those who experience it.\\n\\nI have discovered that one issue that homeless individuals frequently deal with is the deterioration of their health and access to medical care. Homeless.org claims that such individuals have lower physical and mental health than the general public, which results in poor diagnoses and more obstacles to receiving care. Additionally, a report from the Office of National Statistics in 2021 backs up this claim. When compared to the general population of England and Wales, the findings demonstrated that over twice as many persons who were classified as homeless reported having poor or very poor health.\\n\\nSimilarly, a local HealthWatch report from recently on 1,200 homeless people discovered that one of the problems keeping people from accessing healthcare assistance is that they cannot provide a valid address or appropriate identification. Furthermore, some GP practices decline to register persons without an address, despite the fact they are not legally required to do so in order to become a patient. This highlights covert prejudice in the healthcare system towards those who are homeless.\\n\\nAs I conducted this research, it became abundantly evident to me from the previously mentioned issue that the repercussions of homelessness vary from case to case. In the words of one homeless person who spoke with the Guardian, \"No two stories are similar and there seems to be no predictable path from a comfortable home to a life on the streets.\"\\n\\nIn addition, basic needs, income, and access to food and shelter are major problems faced by the homeless population. Living on the streets puts additional pressure on them due to their lack of resources, namely income. They also lack a place to call home and are consumed with finding a way to feed themselves constantly. All of this causes their fundamental needs -- clean clothes, water, and food -- to be disregarded, which makes it harder for them to escape this situation.\\n\\nUser Persona\\n\\nIn ux design, user personas are an essential element that stem from qualitative user research. Making a persona will assist me as a designer in comprehending the demands, experiences, behaviours, as well as goals of my users. It will enable me to provoke strong emotions while encouraging connection with the audience I am targeting. I was able to develop a persona that will direct me through my ideation process and help me develop ideas that offer a fairly positive user experience by leveraging the secondary research I gathered.\\n\\nMind Map\\n\\nI created a mind map as my initial ideation technique. Mind maps are useful for swiftly adding and arranging ideas and thoughts in a format that is easy to look back on and expand upon. It was helpful to me in my instance since it provided me with a better understanding of the features, functionality, and scope of my application.\\n\\nUser Flow\\n\\nI had a much clearer notion of the features I wanted my app to include given that I had previously constructed a mind map, therefore my next ideation technique was to develop a user flow. I was able to map out the user\\'s journey through the application using the user flow, including every step they took from the point of entry to the last interaction.\\n\\nIt was essential to me to take into account the user persona I developed and the findings from the secondary research when creating the user flow. By doing this, I was able to ensure that I remained on course while addressing the demands of the users throughout the design process, and I also gained a deeper understanding and empathy for users.\\n\\nCrazy 8s\\n\\nI choose to brainstorm ideas into visual designs using the crazy 8s method. Using an 8-minute timer, this technique involves drawing 8 distinct designs, ideally spending 1 minute on each design. This method makes it possible for non-designers to participate and generates a large number of concepts quickly. I found it difficult to precisely arrange the content of my designs, so after experimenting with this method, I also used the straw man proposal to add further details to improve the clarity and visual appeal of my designs.\\n\\nStraw Man Proposal\\n\\nThe straw man approach is frequently used to address user issues in a more methodical way. Design teams can discuss, breakdown, and refine their work using this technique, which focuses on potential innovations, improvements, or adjustments based on an initial draft. The process involves getting participants together and having each person work on a design for ten minutes at a time. The group gets together when the allotted time is up and discusses insightful feedback. In my instance, I drew up one of my crazy 8s home screen concepts once more and spent ten minutes refining it.\\n\\nWireframing Phase\\n\\nIn this phase, I took care to develop designs on frames that, assuming their\\n\\ncircumstances, homeless individuals likely would own. In this case, it was the iPhone 8 frame. Furthermore, in an effort to gradually diminish the problem completely, I made sure to incorporate features that catered to all users, regardless of whether they had become homeless or not.\\n\\nLow Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nSketches from my crazy 8s and Straw Man proposal served as a foundation as I developed three app screens into low fidelity wireframes. The home screen, the support screen, and the profile screen formed made up the three screens. I chose to create the screens from the perspective of my user persona as I wanted to make sure that I addressed all the problems that I found during my research and that I kept the user at the forefront for all of my decisions. In order to add to the final screen layouts, I also made the decision to incorporate various elements from my brainstorming sketches into my designs.\\n\\nMid Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nI modified my low fidelity wireframes into mid fidelity wireframes for the following step. During this phase, I made significant adjustments and added more text and icons to my designs, which enabled me to observe them more clearly and provide more depth. I changed the original placeholders for the profile, settings, search bar, map, and navigation bar on my first screen (the home screen) to match their corresponding icons. To improve accessibility and provide more clarification, I also made sure to add additional text to the navigation bar. In addition, I chose to add heart icons to represent the user\\'s ability to favourite their locations and additional arrow icons in place of the original wording \"slide for more\" to make it easier for users to identify and enable them to take action instinctively. Additionally, I learned that by doing this, I had more room to add more content.\\n\\nFollowing this, the process for my other two screens was essentially the same, with a few minor adjustments. I used the exact corresponding symbols that I had originally intended for my placeholders on my support screen, along with new icons like emojis that display the user\\'s daily mood, a donation and share icon, and additional text to reflect the amount donated and the number of supporters. The For You-Explore sidebar was an additional element I created; it was not on my original low-fidelity wireframe. During the design process, I aimed to distinguish between user-specific and non-specific support content-which users may pursue and contribute to their \"For You\" space.\\n\\nRegarding my profile screen, I used the appropriate icons next to the text to further demonstrate proficiency and allow for the overcoming of language hurdles; likewise, I intended for my settings feature to include language preferences for users, allowing them to navigate more freely. Furthermore, I included a calendar icon to assist users stay organised, schedule appropriately, and act as a reminder.\\n\\nHigh Fidelity Wireframes-\\n\\nI added my chosen colour palette to the high fidelity frames and swapped out all the placeholders with imagery that complimented my user persona. In addition to other colours, brown was a crucial component of my frames since I knew how important it was to make use of such colour to influence emotions onto my users as I wanted to ensure that they felt supported as they navigated the app and to know that they could always rely on it to meet their needs. In addition, I was able to prepare my designs for users at this stage by making them as realistic and vivid as possible.\\n\\nHicks Law- Hicks Law was a principle I applied to each of my designs. This is seen on the home page, where I utilise the GPS location scout capability to offer users resources that are in the vicinity for them to use. By reducing content that may possibly overwhelm users and making it simpler for them to select their preferred option, I have increased user engagement with the app. This is also visible on the support screen, where I offer recommendations based on the resources that are specific to them. By doing this, I have reduced cognitive load and made it easier for individuals to look into other resources for support in order to achieve their personal goals.\\n\\nAesthetic Usability Effect- This alludes to the users\\' perception that aesthetically pleasing designs are more functional and accessible at first glance, making minor usability concerns more bearable. In order to make my designs better suited to users\\' visual preferences, I used this law when creating the colour palette and imagery for my designs. Additionally, I made sure that the app\\'s purpose was still being pursued and that the primary function was still given priority.\\n\\nJacobs Law- This refers to the notion that users carry over their expectations from one familiar product to another, assuming identical functionality. To implement this law, I looked at the layout within the Our Calling app, which provided the user nearest facilities on their home page. I then replicated this layout for my own home page. My UI will be easier for users to locate exactly what they are searching for by being designed similarly to a direct competitor like Our Calling, optimising time efficiency and offering users a pleasant, easy-to-navigate experience.\\n\\nMiller\\'s Law- This law alludes to the \"magic number seven,\" which is the idea that the average person can retain about seven objects in working memory. It is known to be more beneficial to divide content into manageable chunks so that individuals can comprehend, absorb, and recall it quicker. Using my support screen, I implemented this law by dividing the support content into \"For You\" and \"Explore\" sections. In order to help users process the information more easily and without feeling overwhelmed, I also made sure that there was a limit of three assistance resources visible to them at any given moment within the personalised area of the screen.\\n\\nTypography\\n\\nI decided to utilise the Roboto typeface, which is part of the sans-serif family. This is because it is known to be a worldwide typeface with a straightforward style, allowing for a more natural reading experience. It is also recognized for functioning well with a variety of devices, sizes, and resolutions, which I make use of. I find it highly valuable because it can be seen on devices such as iOS or Androids, which are widely used today and are therefore more likely to be owned by a homeless person. In addition, I used the font styles for a variety of purposes, including highlighting essential information for the user. By switching between styles and using more kerning, I was able to build hierarchy where it was required in my designs.\\n\\nIt was essential to me to create my designs in accordance with the Equality Act of 2010, which encourages an equal society. It was my responsibility to make my designs more accessible for those with disabilities, as studies have revealed a significant increase in homeless people becoming disabled due to a lack of care. Furthermore, in order to adhere to the WCAG standards, I ensured that my text/font sizes were as perceivable as possible for users, allowing them not to be misread and robust enough to be deciphered by the most commonly used assistance technology such as screen readers/magnifiers. Moreover, I used the figma mirror plugin to guarantee that my icons were large enough for users to tap and did not pose any usability concerns.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOverall, I believe that this case study was a success, allowing me to uncover and learn so much. I was able to successfully follow the double diamond process and create designs to solve my initial problem statement. Through the research, I was able to determine what was a priority for homeless individuals and proceed to concentrate on building fitting screens to assist combat this. However, one surprising finding from my research was the lack of apps meant to combat homelessness and meet the needs of those who are homeless, despite the fact that the issue was at an all-time low during the pandemic due to the public\\'s goodwill in assisting those persons.\\n\\nFurthermore, it would have been more beneficial to have conducted primary research through questionnaires distributed to those who were or are currently homeless, a red route analysis to gather genuine data on what features would be essential to users, along with interviews with charities working to combat the issue. Moreover, I would have preferred to focus on creating my identity page rather than my profile page, which would have enabled users to identify other homeless people by submitting an image/location for members of neighbouring shelters to launch a search and rescue to assist them. I believe this was a fantastic feature that I introduced promptly in my mind map concept, although it would have been good if I had shown how it would have been visually built.\\n\\nLastly, if I had the ability to launch this project, I would have worked jointly with the NHS to provide an outreach service specifically tailored to the primary care of homeless individuals, made up of nurses, therapists, and volunteers.\\n\\nThe Connection at St Martin\\'s.

Today the world is going through a rapid change. Globalizations made possible revolutionary changes or development in information and communications technology. In modern age, we can't think to live without information and technology. Today, computers are considered one of the important things a erson / establishment can utilize. Many people have begun to depend on resources like information and technology to get things properly working on their behalf. The process of sharing the data has become a lot easier., despite the physical distance that may possibly be in between or for those wh Ino are not familiar with the function of the business that are involved in the information technology sector. Information and technology is actually an area where innovations are managed. Technology is making the multifunctional functions to be available in a single device. Thus, we can have multifunctional usage of the single device we own. The simpler the work gets with and the more we get dependent on it. Technology makes us lethargic with little or no physical activity, in one aspect; but the same and provides a creative jobs including physical activity.\\n\\nTechnology makes us dependent on it, hence, technology plays a major role in our lives. Information and technology has a great significance in the field of communication, inventory management, data management, management informative system, education, health sector, agriculture and banking sector, etc.\\n\\nInformation and Technology plays a crucial role in every sphere of life. Modern Information and Technology has become so entrenched in the idea of a modern society that both are closely intertwined with each other. . Developing countries try to get better utilities, more vehicles, faster computers as well as internet and cell phone providers because that's what makes a society modern. Technologies are tools and techniques that support and development of information system. It is important in areas as:\\n\\nHEALTH SECTOR:In the health sector, technology advanced to a great extent that today a machine car assists a person in intensive care and monitor him, which was a tiresome and risky job to do manually before. Automation of processes has brought about efficiency and speed. Speedy performance of tasks has saved human effort and time. With information and technology devices available even in remote villages, there is a potential that technologies could revolutionized health service delivery and acts as a game changer for an effective and people centered healthcare system in the 21st century.\\n\\nEDUCATION:Information and technology play a major role in the modern education. Some are promoted to do inventions. Many wonders of Information and technology such as Radio, television etc. is helpful for the students. Gone are the days of slates and chalks. Teaching through computers will be more effective. In the western world, we see that they have already switched over to this new way of teaching and learning. The computer is not an alternative of teaching but it is an able helper of the teachers. Teachers can teach better through the computer because it an audio-visual means of information.\\n\\nInformation and Communication Technology helps in other areas of modern society such as: communication, data management, inventory management, consumer relationship management, etc.\\n\\nCommunication: for many companies, e-mail is the main means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. E-mail was one of the early drivers of the internet providing a simple and inexpensive means to communicate. Over the years, a number of other communication tools have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat system online meeting tools and video conferencing.\\n\\nData Management:The days of large file rooms, rows of filing cabinets and the mailing of documents is fading fast. Today, most companies store digital versions of documents on servers and storage devices.

Studying this complicated link is a journey to solve the mysteries of our universe and discover our place within it. Understanding the interaction between SMBHs and their host galaxies is important beyond the domains of astrophysics; it has significant significance for our society as a whole. Understanding the complicated interaction between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is important for reasons that go far beyond pure scientific investigation. A supermassive black hole is a point in the center of a galaxy that is extremely massive and dense. The enormous collections of stars, gas, dust, and other materials known as galaxies are now held together by gravity. This strong relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes exists. It resembles an alliance with a difference. The black hole acts as a powerful cosmic vacuum cleaner, drawing objects closer with the force of its strong gravity. Additionally, as the material is drawn in, it heats up and emits energy, including light and X-rays. What is a black hole? Composition and formation: A black hole is an area of space where gravity is so powerful that nothing can escape from it, not even light. This uncommon phenomenon results from large objects collapsing entirely due to their gravitational pull. The enigmatic celestial phenomenon known as a black hole is frequently described as having a \"singularity\" at its center in terms of composition. This singularity is a region of infinite density where the fundamental principles of physics no longer remain accurate. Essentially, it is an area of spacetime where matter has been compressed to a size that is hard to fully understand. They have an event horizon around the singularity. It is a line where nothing can escape due to the strong gravitational force. Due to the absence of any observable radiation from their surface, black holes have a unique look of being \"black\" due to their event horizon. The formation of a black hole can result from numerous processes, each linked to the collision of enormous objects. They come in three main categories. The first category is the stellar-mass black hole. They are created from the remains of large stars that collapsed after running out of nuclear fuel. A big star\\'s center collapses under its gravity when the pressure from nuclear fusion inside it is no longer able to support it. If the collapsing core\\'s mass is substantial, it will continue to fall after the neutron star develops, and eventually collapse into a black hole. The second category is intermediate-mass black holes. There are a variety of ways that these black holes are formed, for example, by the direct collapse of immense gas clouds in the early universe or the merger and collision of smaller black holes. Their exact formation mechanisms are still being researched and understood. The last category of black holes is supermassive black holes. The most massive form of black holes, with masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the Sun, can be found at the centers of most galaxies. Research regarding the exact process of their development is still going on, but one accepted theory proposes that over cosmic periods, mass is gradually accumulated by the absorption of surrounding gas and mergers with other black holes and stars. Understanding their relationship To better understand this, we will look at how their relationship developed over time, galaxy types, and environments, and interacted with dark matter halos (which are collections of dark matter particles, a hypothesized material that doesn\\'t interact with ordinary matter but composes most of the galaxy). Here are a few essential points to keep in mind throughout the evolution of black hole-galaxy connections. These findings provide fascinating insights into the early development of black hole-galaxy connections. Some scaling correlations appear to remain at high redshifts, implying that the links between black hole mass and galaxy features were determined shortly after galaxy formation. However, major variations are discovered, implying that the interaction between black holes and galaxies may have changed in the distant past. The presence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity can be deduced from spectral patterns in high-redshift galaxies, suggesting that black holes were affecting their host galaxies even in the early cosmos. AGN activity has been seen to have feedback effects on the surrounding gas, which may influence star formation. What is AGN? AGN describes a small area near the galactic center that radiates a disproportionately large quantity of energy in the radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X, and gamma-ray bands. Some of the universe\\'s brightest and most energetic objects are AGNs. The accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole at the galaxy\\'s nucleus is thought to be what drives AGNs\\' energy production. An accretion disk is created as matter enters the black hole, producing intense radiation and occasionally strong outflows of particles and energy. Galaxies have a variety of shapes, ranging from spirals to ellipticals. They live in a variety of cosmic contexts, ranging from isolated regions to groupings of galaxies. Understanding how various galaxy types and surroundings affect black hole-galaxy interactions is a step toward understanding cosmic history. Different galaxy shapes may indicate different histories of star formation and fusion events. This can have an impact on the growth of central black holes. Spirals with active star formation may have other black hole-galaxy connections than early-type galaxies with restrained star formation. What is Dark matter? Dark matter is a form that is hypothesized to account for a considerable amount of the universe\\'s mass, even though it does not © 2022 The Authors 2 Diana Elenes emit light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation that we could directly monitor. It was first suggested to clarify the differences between observed gravitational effects in the cosmos and the amount of visible matter that we can detect. Dark matter halos supply the gravitational basis that helps galaxies develop. Understanding how these halos interact with galaxies and their center black holes is very important to understanding the fundamental interactions that drive their co-evolution. The mass of a dark matter halo affects where galaxies and black holes live. The relationship between halo mass and black hole mass gives information on how the gravitational pull of the halo influences the available gas supply for both star formation and black hole accretion. The history of dark matter Halo formation impacts the conditions in which galaxies and black holes form. Late-stage halo mergers may stimulate star formation and black hole accretion, changing the rates of growth of both components. Conversely, the inactive construction of halos may result in restricted growth. Discoveries that have shaped our understanding The relationship between SMBH mass and galaxy properties like star velocity dispersion in the galactic bulge suggests a shared history of growth and change. Their shared trajectory suggests that the origin and evolution of SMBHs and galaxies are closely intertwined. When galaxies evolve, their central SMBHs increase in lockstep, revealing a bond formed in the early phases of cosmic evolution. It also emphasizes the mutual influence that SMBHs and galaxies have on each other\\'s evolution. As SMBHs gain mass and emit energy in the form of radiation, the surrounding universe is affected. The energetic output of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can heat or eject gas, influencing the galaxy\\'s rate and dynamics of star formation. On the other hand, the galaxy\\'s dynamics might determine the availability of gas and dust, which eventually fuel SMBH absorption. Interactions like mergers can direct material into the SMBH, resulting in higher accretion and greater AGN activity. This vicious circle creates an interplay in which the SMBH\\'s expansion affects the evolution of the galaxy and vice versa. As we learn more about this link, we gain insight into the mechanisms that drive galaxy collisions, activate AGNs, and regulate star formation. Understanding these processes not only improves our understanding of the universe\\'s past but also provides hints about its future. We get significant insights into the complicated development of the universe by understanding how galaxies and their central SMBHs co-evolve. Ways of AGN Outflows and SMBHGalaxy Co-evolution: 1. Outflow Generation Mechanisms: AGN outflows can be caused by several factors, including radiation pressure, magneto-hydrodynamic processes, and accretion disk winds. These systems generate outflows with significant kinetic energy capable of impacting the ISM on galactic scales. 2. AGN outflows play an essential role in controlling excessive SMBH growth by eliminating excessive gas from the accumulation disk\\'s vicinity. This process controls the mass accretion rate onto the SMBH, balancing accretion and outflow and preventing the SMBH from limiting its expansion 3. Effects on Star Formation: AGN outflows can pass through the interstellar medium, compressing and heating it. Depending on the timing of the interaction, this compression can either prevent or encourage star formation. AGN-driven outflows may either suppress star development by evacuating gas from star-forming regions or they may initiate star formation in compressed gas regions. In conclusion, the discovery of intense AGN-driven outflows has given us context for the interaction that exists between SMBHs and galaxies. These outflows serve as feedback processes, changing galaxy morphology and influencing star formation rates. The research emphasizes the importance of more observational studies and theoretical advances to get a thorough knowledge of the interactions between AGN outflows, SMBHs, and galaxy evolution. . We are getting closer to comprehending the complexity of the cosmic cycle that connects these two essential components. The quenching of star formation. There are multiple ways, such as 1. The suppression of star formation caused by AGN feedback is one of the most fascinating features of the interaction between SMBHs and galaxies. This phenomenon is a critical link between the evolution of SMBHs and the evolution of galaxies, emphasizing the complex and symbiotic interaction that exists between these cosmic entities. 2. Observational: A few observational studies have provided compelling evidence for the quenching effect of AGN feedback on star formation. 3. Morphological Quenching: Certain galaxies have specific morphological traits, like massive protuberances or elliptical forms, that are frequently associated with inactive, non-star-forming systems. The expulsion of gas by AGN outflows can cause diskdominated galaxies to convert into spheroidal, quenched systems. 4. Radio Mode AGNs: Radio-loud AGNs, which emit intense radio emissions, are typically found in elliptical galaxies with little star production. The energy released via radio emissions is thought to be a major contributor to AGN feedback and quenching in these systems. As we have pretty good knowledge about the quenching effect of AGN feedback, we still have some questions, for example, 1. How do the durations of AGN flow impact star formation and relate to AGN activity lifetimes? 2. How does AGN variability add to the cyclic structure of star formation cooling? 3. How does a galaxy\\'s environment impact the relationship between AGN feedback and star formation? 4. Do galaxies in diverse positions have different quenching mechanisms? In a few words, the reduction of star formation by AGN feedback is a powerful demonstration of the precise interplay between supermassive black holes and galaxies. The ability to produce new stars is greatly limited as AGNs remove heat gas from a galaxy\\'s center regions. This quenching effect affects not just individual galaxies but also the galaxy population as a whole and the evolution of structures across cosmic time. Continued research into this phenomenon has the potential to reveal the essential mechanisms that drive the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies, shedding light on the fundamental processes that build the intricate weave of our universe. The Influence of AGN Feedback on Galaxy-SMBH Co-Evolution 1. The Independence Theory, which holds that the expansion of SMBHs at the centers of galaxies and the development of their host galaxies are mostly independent processes, was contested by Philip F. Hopkins in 2006. This theory, which proposed that SMBHs and galaxies form independently and with little to no reciprocal interaction, was widely accepted in the area of astrophysics. Hopkins\\' research used hydrodynamic models to investigate the effect of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback on star formation rates in galaxies, offering a novel viewpoint. The energy and matter released during the accretion of material onto a core SMBH are referred to as AGN feedback. This feedback may manifest as radiation, jets, or outflows that modify the interstellar medium in the vicinity. Further investigation into the mechanics of AGN feedback and its function in galaxy development has been sparked by this new perspective, which has caused a change in our understanding of how galaxies and their central black holes evolve over cosmic time. The study proposed that AGN feedback functions as a regulatory mechanism that influences the formation of galaxies. AGN feedback may potentially stop or slow down the formation of a galaxy\\'s central bulge, affecting the galaxy\\'s general evolution, by ejecting gas from the center regions. Feedback Loop: The data suggested a feedback loop involving the galaxy and the SMBH. The galaxy\\'s gas reservoir and the interstellar medium are both impacted by the SMBH\\'s accretion of matter and energy, which in turn alters the circumstances for star formation. 2. Tiziana Di Matteo carried out ground-breaking computer simulations in 2005 that shed light on how Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback affects galaxy evolution. Her studies showed how AGN feedback can cause galaxies to release large amounts of gas into space, suppressing star formation and changing galaxy shapes. The prevailing wisdom that the expansion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxy evolution are separate processes was contested by this study. Principal Results of Di Matteo\\'s Research Outflows Caused by AGN Activity: Di Matteo\\'s simulations showed that outflows of gas from galaxies can be strongly influenced by the energy released by AGN activity. These outflows effectively stop or quench star formation in the afflicted regions by carrying a sizable amount of gas and energy away from the galactic core. Star Formation Suppression: The study showed that star formation rates are directly affected by AGN feedback-induced outflows. AGN feedback can make it difficult for young stars to form by ejecting gas and causing disruptions in the interstellar medium. Co-evolutionary Evidence from Observation 1. SMBHs and their host galaxies were the subject of a large study carried out in 2002 by Paul T. P. Ho and C. Megan Urry. They found empirical support for a high correlation between the mass of SMBHs and particular characteristics of their host galaxies. This link highlighted how the development of SMBHs and their galactic hosts is interdependent. Important Results: The study by Woo and Urry, \"SMBH Mass and Host Galaxy Features,\" found a connection between the mass of the central SMBH and a few observable host galaxy characteristics, such as the velocity dispersion of stars in the bulge and the luminosity of the galaxy\\'s core. This correlation showed a basic connection between the galaxy\\'s characteristics and the black hole\\'s development. Galaxy-Black Hole Co-Evolution: The observed link suggested that SMBHs and galaxies have undergone co-evolution. SMBHs appear to have an impact on the dynamics and evolution of their host galaxies as they expand through accretion processes. Connection to Galactic Bulges: The relationship between velocity dispersion in the bulge and SMBH growth suggests that the development and evolution of galactic bulges may be related. The coincidence raised the possibility that the same forces responsible for SMBH growth could also be at work in the galactic nucleus. Galaxy Evolution Models: Woo and Urry\\'s findings challenged previous ideas that black hole and galaxy evolution occurred independently. New models that take into account the feedback and interactions between these two components are being considered in light of the empirical relationship between SMBH mass and galaxy characteristics. Black Hole Growth Mechanisms: The study indicated that the presence of gas reservoirs within galaxies is related to SMBH growth. The processes influencing galactic evolution appeared to be connected with the mechanisms that control gas availability and initiate AGN activity. Woo and Urry\\'s study gave us a quantitative foundation for understanding the interaction between these two essential elements of galactic systems by establishing a quantifiable relationship between SMBH mass and observable host galaxy properties. The complicated and intricate character of the interactions between galaxies was underlined by this empirical relationship, which also brought up significant issues regarding the processes underlying their co-evolution. 2. Using data from the Galaxy Zoo project, Kevin Schawinski carried out a study in 2009 to look at the connections between AGNs, galaxy morphologies, and interactions. His work provided insight into the relationship between AGN activity, galaxy disruption, and the feedback mechanisms that affect both the host galaxy and the SMBH at its center. Important Results: The influence of the AGN feedback on galaxy disruption processes was suggested by the study\\'s findings. AGN feedback, which involves the ejection of matter and energy from the central SMBH, may have an impact on the dynamical development and morphology of the galaxy. Mutual Influence: The results provided evidence for the interaction between galaxies and AGNs. Both the SMBH and the host galaxy may be affected, changing their physical and morphological properties as a result of interaction-driven AGN fueling and subsequent feedback processes. Galaxy Evolution: According to Schawinski\\'s research, AGNs may influence galaxy evolution through interactions, mergers, and feedback. Observational proof of the dynamic interaction between SMBHs and galaxies was supplied by the relationship between AGN activity and disturbed galaxy morphologies. Linked Histories and Feedback Mechanisms: In 2012, Andrew C. Fabian conducted a study that focused on the significant role of AGN outflows in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and influencing star formation processes. His research highlighted the intricate feedback loop between AGN activity, SMBH expansion, and the availability of gas for star formation. Important Results: Positive and Negative Feedback: The ISM may be affected positively or negatively by AGN feedback processes. When some parts of the gas are compressed by AGN-driven outflows, fresh star formation is stimulated. When AGN outflows evacuate gas and prevent star formation, negative feedback ensues. The enormous and intricate mixture of gas, dust, and other stuff that fills the space between stars in a galaxy is known as the interstellar medium (ISM). It provides the raw materials for star formation, fills the spaces between stars, and creates the conditions for a variety of astrophysical activities. Galaxy evolution is regulated by the feedback relationship between AGN activity, gas ejection, and star formation. It implies that the development of host galaxies and the growth of SMBHs are interdependent processes, where the energy generated by AGNs can impact the evolution of the galaxy\\'s ISM and shape the formation of the SMBH. The ISM plays an important role for a variety of reasons: The ISM offers the required building blocks for the creation of new stars. Molecular clouds can contain dense regions that can collapse under the force of their gravity, creating protostars and eventually new stars. Astrophysical Processes: : The ISM is the site of numerous significant astrophysical processes, including cosmic ray propagation, magnetic field interactions, and shockwaves from supernova explosions. Galactic evolution is governed by feedback systems, which include the ISM. Star formation and other phenomena can be affected by processes like stellar winds, supernova explosions, and the activity of active galactic nuclei, which can return energy and matter to the ISM. Feedback Loop Mechanism: A feedback loop is produced by the AGN feedback\\'s outflows. The amount of gas available for star formation is impacted by the AGN\\'s gas emission. This in turn affects the galaxy\\'s star formation\\'s speed and effectiveness. The study hypothesized that AGN outflows might reduce the gas supply in the center parts of galaxies, which would quench star formation. The amount of gas that is available to create new stars may be reduced as a result of this depletion, thus quenching or suppressing star formation. 2. As distinct phases of AGN feedback, King (2005) proposed the \"quasar mode\" and \"radio mode.\" Quasar mode is defined by radiation pressure-driven outflows that impact star formation, whereas radio mode is characterized by jet-driven feedback that expels gas, therefore avoiding star formation. Furthermore, the discoveries of AGN-driven feedback have changed how we think about galaxySMBH co-evolution. This literature review highlights the shift from the idea of an isolated galaxy and the evolution of the SMBH through an examination of theoretical models, research, and observational evidence. Instead, the dynamic feedback processes and shared histories that tie together the growth paths of SMBHs and galaxies are emphasized by these studies. Research in this area is expected to advance and eventually, reveal more about this complex interplay. Association between SMBH Mass and Host Galaxy Properties: It was found a surprising association between the mass of the core SMBH and the characteristics of the host galaxy\\'s bulge through research of a broad sample of galaxies. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, succeeded in verifying this link and discovering a statistically significant correlation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.76 and a p-value of 0.001. The co-evolutionary theory, according to which the expansion of the SMBH and the bulge of the galaxy are connected, is supported by this correlation. The feedback processes by which SMBHs affect their host galaxies It was discovered by analyzing radio observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and X-ray data from Chandra. These outflows add energy to the interstellar medium in the area, possibly controlling star formation. These outflows\\' spectrum examination revealed velocities of up to 0.1 c, highlighting their potential influence on the galactic environment. Consequences for Galaxy Evolution Models: Our findings have significant consequences for galaxy evolution models. The relationship between SMBH mass and galaxy bulge characteristics provides support to the idea that both parts have a similar growth mechanism, which may be influenced by merger and accretion events. The discovered feedback mechanisms highlight the function of SMBHs in controlling star formation and preserving the harmony of galactic ecosystems. Joint Growth Process: The relationship between galactic bulge properties and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass points to a shared growth process for these two elements. According to this association, mergers and accretion events may be responsible for both the SMBH and the central bulge of a galaxy\\'s history. The SMBH and the surrounding bulge can both gain mass as a result of these occurrences. The interconnection of the mechanisms influencing galaxy structure is highlighted by this cooperative growth mechanism, which casts doubt on earlier theories that these two components form independently. Evolution Driven by Mergers: It is well known that the evolution of galaxies is greatly influenced by mergers between them. The relationship found between SMBH mass and galaxy bulge properties supports the idea that galaxy mergers are a primary factor in the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies. The center SMBHs of the progenitor galaxies mix as well as galaxies combine, possibly causing the resulting SMBH to develop rapidly and triggering feedback processes. The SMBH\\'s expansion as well as the star formation in the bulge may be fueled by these mergers, which might also set off powerful accretion events.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*kFrc4tBFM_tCis-2Ic87WA.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 53, 'relevance': 53}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-397066848', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '11:46:32', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T11:46:32Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T11:34:26Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@julian_66224/time-to-reshuffle-ed2dc8024fc3', 'title': 'Time to reshuffle?', 'body': 'Researchers, maybe it\\'s time we reshuffle the cards.\\n\\nI was reading User Interviews\\'s State of UXR 2024 Report just now and I\\'m trying to wrap my head around some of the stuff there.\\n\\nAccording to the study, slowly but steadily, user research is more valued across the board.\\n\\nApparently, buy-in starts to be less of a problem, there\\'s more awareness of the importance of conducting research and there seems to be more interest in insights. Research finally started \"talking the language of the business\" (rolling my eyes as I write this).\\n\\nLet alone those companies that still don\\'t have a researcher and are still not even considering the possibility. These are not featured in the report and it\\'s where a lot of potential future researcher jobs lie.\\n\\nOn top of that, researchers seem to now allocate more and more of their time to giving support to other roles, whether through teaching, training or working on the infrastructure. Slightly moving towards an enablement or empowerment function. Probably as a response to being outnumbered, maybe as a consequence of leadership decisions or simply to adapt to a new reality.\\n\\nThis last bit is a consequence of the rising popularity of Product Discovery and Democratization. More and more companies are trying these things out and the number of PWDR (People Who Do Research) is increasing, as well as the ratio PWDR to Researchers (more than doubled in two years!), naturally. As I said in this 2023 talk, research is getting messy.\\n\\nIn a nutshell: it seems companies want more insights but do not necessarily want to invest in researchers, who are, in turn, asked to empower other roles in insight collection tasks. More research happening, less researchers.\\n\\nThe current situation is inviting us (or should I say forcing us?) to rethink how we position ourselves and what role we should play in the team.\\n\\nNow comes the opinion part.\\n\\nFor me, it\\'s all about the value researchers bring to a company and how it\\'s perceived.\\n\\nFor quite some time, we researchers focused on the collection of data. We gathered insights, we brought the customer\\'s voice into the organization. We went, did the research, came back and delivered the results.\\n\\nSecond, if the value we propose to an org resides only in the collection of data, not only we\\'re exposing ourselves to be replaced but also we\\'re not exploiting our potential to the max. We\\'re leaving so much on the table.\\n\\nWhen money is tight, a quick workaround seems to be reducing the number of researchers (or cutting them out altogether) and having the collection done by other roles. Even if the quality is not the same.\\n\\n\"Why have researchers do research when it can be done by designers or PMs?\" some leaders might think.\\n\\nWhen the number of researchers in a company is low, we are asked to do more with less and we need to be smart about where to strike to make the most impact.\\n\\nSome might argue that the most impact can be achieved by moving \"upwards\" in the range of research that we do, and if we\\'re allowed to work on more strategic projects, our impact will be seen. And that\\'s fair, that\\'s one way to look at it. However, for me, that\\'d still be pairing our value with the data collection.\\n\\nThe move towards more ReOps tasks makes sense. Research doesn\\'t happen magically and you need to have the right infrastructure to make it happen. Plus, you also want to ensure a certain standard. Having said that, I believe it doesn\\'t end there.\\n\\nI believe researchers can help organizations learn more and better by empowering other teams, then connect all that knowledge that\\'s produced and by having this nurtured 360-view, inform decisions at different levels.\\n\\nI\\'m a football fan (you now get all the Messi references in my content?) so I like to use the term playmaker.

The IPB Digitani application is supported by an administrator who helps the process of consultation activities as a form of information distribution. Information distribution is an important task of the administrator who will assign questions from farmers and agricultural extension workers to IPB experts who are relevant to the question. However, an in-depth analysis of the administrator\\'s needs has not been conducted. Therefore, deeper research is needed to design and test improvements to the IPB Digitani application administrator web prototype based on user needs. This research used The Five Planes method and collected retrospecitve think aloud, completion rate, time based efficiency, and misclicked data during testing. The test results were analyzed as a consideration in designing and identifying user needs. Comparison of existing and proposed design test results concluded that the proposed design can improve administrator productivity performance.\\n\\nKeywords: retrospective think aloud, the five planes, web administrator\\n\\n1.1 Background\\n\\nThe majority of productive farmers in Indonesia are over 40 years old, with 70% having only elementary education or less (Setyawan 2020). This lack of formal education has led to stagnation and even decline in Indonesia\\'s agricultural sector. Farmers often lack access to the latest innovations and knowledge needed to enhance agricultural productivity.\\n\\nTo address this, Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) launched IPB Digitani, a digital platform facilitating information exchange and solutions for agricultural issues among farmers, agricultural advisors, and IPB experts. Developed by IPB\\'s Institute for Information Management and Digital Transformation (LMITD) and managed by the Tani Center, this platform aims to accelerate agricultural advancement through technology (Barlian 2020).\\n\\nThe IPB Digitani application includes a web administrator to manage its features, particularly consultations between farmers and IPB experts. Farmers need dynamic information about new technologies and two-way communication with experts to address agricultural problems (Panda et al. 2019).\\n\\nPrevious research on web admin design in the agricultural sector focused on information media and marketing, such as the web admin application for farmers in Nagari Alahan Panjang, Solok Regency (Meidina et al. 2020). However, these applications lack consultation features between farmers and agricultural experts.\\n\\nPoor admin experience leads to errors in managing IPB Digitani\\'s features, especially in distributing farmers\\' requests to IPB experts. Problems reported by IPB Digitani admins include a cluttered dashboard, non-intuitive call-to-action buttons, a cumbersome user admission feature, and suboptimal request tracking. The admin website fails to meet fundamental user experience aspects essential for product success.\\n\\nThis study aims to redesign and enhance the user experience of the IPB Digitani admin website using The Five Planes methodology, with usability evaluation through the Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA) method, measuring completion rate, time-based efficiency, and misclicks to identify admin needs and improve user experience.\\n\\n1.2 Problem Statement\\n\\nThe research aims to evaluate the IPB Digitani admin website and enhance admin productivity by designing a user experience that addresses the primary needs and issues of IPB Digitani admins, providing improvement recommendations through a comparative evaluation of the existing and proposed design prototypes.\\n\\n1.3 Objectives\\n\\nThe objectives of this study are to identify the needs of the Tani Center as the web administrator in facilitating consultations between farmers, advisors, and IPB experts, and to design and test an improved admin web prototype to enhance the Tani Center\\'s user experience.\\n\\n1.4 Benefits\\n\\nThis research aims to improve the features of the IPB Digitani admin website, aligning them with user needs, thereby facilitating the Tani Center\\'s role in managing consultations and information distribution between farmers, advisors, and IPB experts.\\n\\nIPB Digitani is a technological advancement in agriculture, designed to connect IPB experts with farmers via a website and mobile app. It shares agricultural knowledge developed at IPB. This application, developed from a research roadmap (2016-2020) by the SEIS Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, FMIPA IPB (Setyatama 2016), is managed by LMITD and Tani Center at IPB (Barlian 2020).

These phases build sequentially from abstract to concrete, affecting each subsequent phase (Maggenta et al. 2022).\\n\\n2.3 Retrospective Think Aloud\\n\\nRetrospective think aloud is a usability testing method where users verbalize their thoughts after completing tasks. This method, identified by Nielsen (2012) and Ericsson and Simon (1993), involves recording user activities for detailed analysis (Nielsen 1993).\\n\\n3.1 Research Data\\n\\nThis study employs quantitative performance measurement data from respondents completing task scenarios. The data is collected from two Tani Center web administrators. Performance measurement assesses the variables of effectiveness and efficiency, following ISO 9241-11 (ISO 2018) guidelines. Effectiveness is defined as users\\' ability to achieve specific goals in a given context, while efficiency relates to the resources used relative to the accuracy and completeness of tasks performed by users.\\n\\nEffectiveness is measured by the success and failure rates of tasks completed by respondents. Success is assigned a binary value of \"1\" if the respondent completes the task and \"0\" if they fail. The effectiveness rate is calculated using the completion rate formula:\\n\\nEffectiveness is also evaluated through the analysis of error rates, specifically misclicks, which occur when users inadvertently click unintended elements. The misclicked percentage is calculated using the formula:\\n\\nEfficiency is measured by task time, which is the time required for participants to successfully complete tasks (Wahyuningrum 2021). Time-based efficiency is calculated using the ratio of task completion rate to the time taken to complete the task scenario. The formula for time-based efficiency is:\\n\\nWhere N is the total number of task scenarios, R is the number of users, nij is the success value of respondent j on task i (with a value of 1 for success and 0 for failure), and tij is the time taken by respondent j to complete task i.\\n\\nThis study utilizes The Five Planes and Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA) methods.\\n\\n3.2.1 Evaluating Existing Design\\n\\nUsability testing involves two web administrators of the IPB Digitani application. Before conducting RTA evaluation, task scenarios and interview questions are prepared. Participants provide feedback after task completion, and data on completion rate, time-based efficiency, and misclicks are collected (Tullis and Albert 2023).\\n\\n3.2.2 Strategy Plane\\n\\nThis stage analyzes user needs and product development goals to create a balance.

Performance measurements such as time-based efficiency and misclicked percentage show significant improvements in usability. Verbal responses from the Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA) sessions on the proposed design were predominantly positive. Utilizing the five planes method, the study effectively identified user problems, developed both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes with essential interaction features, and refined designs based on recommendations from evaluations using \"8 Golden Rules of Interface Design\" and \"Heuristic Evaluation\".\\n\\n5.2 Recommendations\\n\\nIt is recommended to conduct more in-depth testing using a user testing platform to obtain more accurate heatmap data. Implementing Maze tracking code and snippet code on the IPB Digitani web application could provide deeper insights into user interactions. Given the purposive sampling method used, the next steps should involve a broader range of users from the Tani Center, including those who lack experience as administrators of the IPB Digitani application. Random sampling should also be considered to ensure comprehensive coverage of user needs and issues. Preparation should be made for potential administrator turnover to facilitate more efficient adaptation to the application.\\n\\nPrototypeTask Completion RateTime Based Efficiency (goal/sec)Misclicked PercentageExisting Design100%0.142120%Proposed Design100%0.373317.5%\\n\\nThese evaluations underscored the effectiveness of design improvements in enhancing usability, efficiency, and user experience in the proposed application design.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*YM1zW_hjrQJ99TeDerXvdA.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1607843137254903, 'wgt': 52, 'relevance': 52}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-396075318', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '15:01:34', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T15:01:34Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T14:40:32Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@Nitin.Pradhan/navigating-us-federal-opportunities-a-comprehensive-guide-for-canadian-companies-by-scaleup-usa-75dc9a7263d7', 'title': 'Navigating US Federal Opportunities: A Comprehensive Guide for Canadian Companies by ScaleUP USA', 'body': \"A Guilde by ScaleUP USA | Federal Business Accelerator\\n\\nWelcome to the ScaleUP USA's Federal Business Accelerator podcast!

Always refer to official government websites for the most current information. This podcast and our online programs aim to inform you about the challenges, opportunities, problems, and solutions involved in building a US federal government practice. They are not intended to serve as legal or financial advice.\\n\\nThe US Federal Government: A Vast Marketplace:\\n\\nThe US federal government is the world's largest marketplace, with annual expenditures of over $9.3 trillion in FY 2023. In FY 2022, the federal government spent:\\n\\nAdditionally, the federal government is a major employer, providing jobs to over 10 million federal employees, contractors, and others as of 2023, making it a significant player in the global economy.\\n\\nThe Federal Problem:\\n\\nLess than 1% of the 33+ million businesses in the US are registered to do business with the federal government. There is no formal learning process in place to guide them through the complex process of visioning, strategizing, planning, implementing, and continuously improving their federal business growth and execution strategy. As a result, many businesses resort to trial and error, which often leads to failure.\\n\\nThe Canadian Economy and US Federal Opportunities:\\n\\nThe Canadian economy, while stable and growing, has limitations that can hinder the growth of companies. With a population of just over 37 million, the domestic market is relatively small, restricting the potential for scaling up. Additionally, the Canadian government's procurement budget is limited, offering fewer opportunities for companies to secure large contracts.\\n\\nIn contrast, the US federal government offers a vast and diverse market, with a procurement budget of over $9.3 trillion in 2023, providing unparalleled opportunities for growth. By working with the US federal government, Canadian companies can:\\n\\nFAR and DFAR Explained:\\n\\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is a comprehensive set of rules governing all aspects of federal government procurement in the United States. It ensures that purchasing procedures are conducted in a fair, transparent, and consistent manner across all federal agencies. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFAR) is an extension of FAR specifically tailored for the Department of Defense (DoD). DFAR includes additional regulatory requirements and policies that address the unique needs of defense-related acquisitions.\\n\\nCanadian Firms Working with the US Federal Government:\\n\\nCanadian firms looking to work with the US federal government must understand and comply with the FAR and DFAR clauses that apply to their contracts. FAR includes provisions that ensure foreign firms, including those from Canada, meet the same stringent standards as domestic companies in areas such as quality assurance, pricing, and ethical conduct. One of the key FAR clauses for Canadian companies is FAR 52.225, which addresses the Buy American Act and Trade Agreements Act. Under these clauses, Canadian products and services can be used in federal contracts due to trade agreements between the US and Canada, such as the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement). This often provides Canadian firms with a competitive edge over firms from countries without similar agreements.\\n\\nUnder DFAR, Canadian firms must navigate additional requirements when dealing with the DoD. DFAR clauses, such as DFAR 252.225, impose specific regulations on the acquisition of defense articles and services, ensuring compliance with national security measures and restrictions on sourcing materials from certain countries. Canadian firms benefit from the US-Canada Defense Production Sharing Agreement, which allows them to participate in US defense procurements on nearly equal footing with US firms. However, they must still comply with cybersecurity requirements as outlined in DFAR 252.204-7012, which mandates that contractors protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within their information systems. By thoroughly understanding and adhering to these FAR and DFAR clauses, Canadian firms can successfully engage in federal contracts while ensuring compliance with US regulations and standards.\\n\\nTraditional US Federal Market Entry Budgets:\\n\\nTraditionally, Canadian companies seeking to tap into the vast US federal marketplace must be prepared to invest in their success. The estimated annual budget ranges from $440,000 to $900,000 to get started, broken down into:\\n\\nHowever, by leveraging ScaleUP USA's Federal Business Accelerator innovative three-tier program and partner network, these costs can be reduced to around $100,000 per year plus a share of the profits or equity.\\n\\nFederal Business Accelerator Bundled Program:\\n\\nWe designed the Federal Business Accelerator Foundational Bundled Program to equip US, Canadian, and other global companies with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the US federal market.

It's a great stepping stone for companies looking to expand their global presence in the US.\\n\\nCanadian companies seeking to work with the US federal government can leverage several specific programs and strategies to overcome common challenges and maximize opportunities.\\n\\nCanadian Commercial Corporation (CCC):\\n\\nThe CCC is a federal Crown corporation that acts as a prime contractor with the US federal government and subcontracts to Canadian companies. This government-to-government contracting model provides assurance to US federal buyers about the reliability of Canadian suppliers. The CCC facilitates access to US Department of Defense (DoD) contracts, helping Canadian companies navigate the complexities of US federal procurement.\\n\\nFederal Technology Transfer (FCT) Program:\\n\\nThe FCT program is designed to commercialize federally developed technology through partnerships with industry. Canadian companies can participate in this program to develop and market products based on US federal technology, fostering innovation and cross-border collaboration.\\n\\nOther Transaction Authority (OTA):\\n\\nOTAs are flexible procurement instruments used by the DoD and other federal agencies to acquire research and development and prototype projects. Canadian companies can operationalize OTAs by partnering with US firms or consortia that have access to these agreements. This approach allows for quicker and more flexible acquisition processes compared to traditional federal contracts.\\n\\nUnderstanding and Leveraging Procurement Vehicles:\\n\\nCanadian startups can utilize various procurement vehicles, such as the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule, which provides access to federal, state, and local government buyers with guidance from government acquisition law firms. While Canadian companies don't qualify for small business set-asides, they can compete for full and open competition contracts and subcontracting opportunities with some restrictions. Check the Federal Business Accelerator program for building a US federal government strategy.\\n\\nRelationship Building and Local Government Consultants:\\n\\nBuilding strong relationships with US government agencies and utilizing local government consultants can significantly enhance a Canadian company's ability to secure contracts. These consultants can provide insights into procurement processes, introduce key stakeholders, and help navigate regulatory requirements. Complete the Federal Business Accelerator program before you embark on this step, so you don't waste your funds on unneeded consultants.\\n\\nCybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC):\\n\\nThe CMMC initiative aims to enhance cybersecurity practices within the defense industrial base. Canadian companies providing cybersecurity solutions can align their offerings with CMMC requirements to better position themselves for DoD contracts.\\n\\nFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP):\\n\\nCanadian companies offering cloud services can seek FedRAMP authorization to provide secure cloud solutions to US federal agencies. This certification demonstrates compliance with stringent security standards, making it easier to compete for federal contracts.\\n\\nJoint Certification Program (JCP):\\n\\nThe JCP certifies companies to access unclassified military technical data. Updating certifications and ensuring compliance with JCP standards can help Canadian companies engage more effectively with the DoD and other federal entities.\\n\\nState and Local Government (SLED) Accounts:\\n\\nAdhering to initiatives like the White House memorandum M-22-09, which mandates cybersecurity and IT modernization efforts, can open doors for Canadian companies to participate in state and local government contracts. Understanding and aligning with these initiatives is crucial for success.\\n\\nCybersecurity within K12 Educational Institutions:\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) encourages collaboration with state planning committees to leverage funding for cybersecurity improvements in K12 education. Canadian companies can participate in grant-approved services by aligning their offerings with state and federal cybersecurity initiatives.\\n\\nMarket Research and Understanding Buying Patterns:\\n\\nConduct thorough market research to understand the buying patterns of US government agencies, particularly the DoD. Identifying procurement trends and aligning offerings with agency needs can increase the likelihood of securing contracts. As mentioned, the Federal Business Accelerator program can help.\\n\\nCompliance and Certifications:\\n\\nObtain necessary certifications, such as CMMC and FedRAMP, to meet compliance requirements. Staying updated on regulatory changes and ensuring adherence to standards is critical for maintaining eligibility and competitiveness.\\n\\nStrategic Partnerships:\\n\\nForm strategic partnerships with US-based companies to leverage their existing relationships and contractual mechanisms. Joint ventures and subcontracting can provide a pathway to enter the US federal market. Check out the Teaming Course in the Federal Business Accelerator for building the most effective and efficient Strategic partnerships.\\n\\nGovernment Relations and Advocacy:\\n\\nEngage in government relations and advocacy efforts to stay informed about policy changes and emerging opportunities.

Ensure you are subscribed to the ScaleUP USA podcast and the Federal Business Accelerator bundle for valuable tips and tricks to grow your federal business.\\n\\nBy leveraging these programs and strategies, Canadian companies can effectively navigate the US federal procurement landscape, overcome challenges, and secure valuable contracts with US government agencies.\\n\\nOne of the questions we often receive is whether Green Card holders and H1B visa holders can work in the US federal government ecosystem. Our research has found the following:\\n\\nGreen Card Holders (Permanent Residents):\\n\\nGreen card holders are generally eligible to work directly for the US federal government as employees, enjoying the same employment rights and benefits as US citizens in many agencies. This includes opportunities for security clearances and career advancement within federal agencies. Unlike H1B visa holders, green card holders do not require sponsorship from a private employer to secure government positions.\\n\\nH1B Visa Holders: Doing Government Contracts as a Contractor:\\n\\nH1B visa holders can contribute to US federal government projects indirectly through employment with private companies that hold certain government agency contracts. These companies sponsor the H1B visa and manage employment compliance with US immigration laws and regulations. Generally, H1B visa holders cannot become government employees directly, unless specific legislative exemptions or rare program provisions apply.\\n\\nAdditional Considerations:\\n\\nBoth H1B visa and green card holders may need to meet security clearance requirements for certain federal roles, with processes varying based on agency, individual circumstances, and position prerequisites. Employers engaging H1B visa holders for government contracts must also ensure compliance with all relevant immigration laws and contractual obligations stipulated by federal agencies.\\n\\nJoin us at www.scaleupUS.com and begin your journey to federal contracting success today.

However, current methods for extracting this data result introduce noise and low resolution, degrading the final image quality. To address this, researchers employed a deep learning technique, which effectively eliminated noise and improved the quality of light field data extracted from holograms. This innovative method allows the editing of light field data and consequently the generation of high-quality holograms.\\n\\nHolography is a fascinating technology that allows the generation of three-dimensional (3D) images, called holograms, with applications in a wide variety of fields. However, there are several challenges in the way of achieving commercial-grade holograms due to the lack of appropriate optical devices, among which, the editing of holograms is a key issue. To edit a hologram, accurate information on the 3D object portrayed by the hologram is required. Despite much research, techniques for extracting this information are still not known.\\n\\nOne way to extract the 3D object information is to acquire light field data instead of an actual 3D model. Light field data consists of light rays emanating from a 3D object, represented as a set of views from multiple angles. This light field data can then be modified and recreated as a hologram using a computer. In this process, the quality of the extracted light field data is the most important factor that influences the quality of the final modified hologram. Light field data can be extracted by passing the angular spectrum of the light from a 3D object through a band-pass filter. However, this method has several issues, including low spatial resolution, blurring and speckle noise, which degrade image quality during extraction.\\n\\nTo address these issues, Dr. Dae-youl Park from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute in Korea employed an innovative new method for processing extracted light-field data. \"We employed a deep learning technique to improve the quality of the light field, which compensates for the inevitable degradation in image quality of extracted light field and enables the creation of an edited hologram with the same quality as the original image\", explains Dr. Park. Their study was published in the ETRI Journal on 5 July, 2023.\\n\\nTo remove speckle noise and blurring, and to improve spatial resolution, the researchers employed a generative adversarial network based deep learning model. This model is comprised of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. The function of the generator model is to generate an image similar to the real image, while the discriminator compares the real and generated images. During the training of this model, the extracted light field data from the DIV2K image set was used as input to the generator to create a speckle and noise-free image and the comparisons provided by the discriminator were used to improve the overall performance of the generator.\\n\\nThe trained generator was then tested by generating holograms of various objects with different depth characteristics. Testing revealed that the model was able to generate high-quality holograms regardless of the hologram generation method or the position of the bandpass filter.\\n\\nHighlighting the importance of the study, Dr. Park remarks: \"Holographic technology will bring about significant changes for us.

Double-checking all addresses before executing any transactions is vital to prevent loss of assets due to human error or clipboard hijacking malware.\\n\\nFinally, maintain a vigilant posture by frequently monitoring for software updates from your wallet provider.

Cryptocurrency airdrops, despite their gratuitous nature, may be taxable events under certain jurisdictions, such as the United States.\\n\\nTherefore, recipients of Catamoto $CATA airdrops should maintain meticulous records of their transactions. This includes dates, market values at the time of receipt (establishing a basis for capital gains calculations), and the details of the airdrop event.\\n\\nMany nations now require exchanges and wallet providers to report cryptocurrency transactions to tax authorities. This transparency means that the onus to report accurately falls on both the service providers and the users alike.\\n\\nParticipation in airdrops should not be made without prior consultation with a tax professional. Understanding the implications of receiving a new asset and reporting it correctly can prevent potential legal and financial repercussions in the future.\\n\\nUltimately, due diligence is vital for anyone engaging with cryptocurrency airdrops. Proper compliance and tax planning are integral to ensuring that these ventures into digital currencies remain both profitable and lawful.\\n\\nIn the quest for maximizing potential airdrop rewards, strategic engagement is paramount. Participants must scrutinize each airdrop\\'s requirements and underlying value proposition to discern merit and potential return on investment.\\n\\nTo leverage airdrops to their fullest extent, one should consider diversifying across various blockchain ecosystems and staying abreast of community news and updates. This proactive stance facilitates early participation in promising airdrops, thus optimizing the chances of higher payouts.\\n\\nEngage with caution and diligence, for \"free\" tokens may bear hidden costs, especially considering transaction fees and tax implications.

Their role is akin to a lighthouse guiding ships -- the aggregators direct users to potentially valuable digital assets amidst a sea of incessant offerings.\\n\\nCommunity participation is fundamental in airdrops.\\n\\nEffective airdrop campaigns are predicated on a strong community relationship. They typically require users to engage with the project on various platforms, which might include social media followings, forum participation, or content creation. Consequently, projects aiming to distribute airdrops frequently leverage these activities to bolster their user base and enhance network value.\\n\\nEngagement is the lynchpin of airdrop success.\\n\\nTo partake, a harmonious blend of vigilance and interaction is paramount. Individuals are commonly prompted to join telegraphic channels or disseminate information on social networks. This symbiotic exchange -- promoters garner visibility while recipients gain tokens -- frames the essence of community-oriented strategies within the airdrop paradigm.\\n\\nAirdrops rely on mutual efficacy of community and project.\\n\\nThe virtuous cycle of community engagement leads to enriched dialogues, user education, and more profound allegiance to the project. By cultivating active participation throughout 2023, projects aspire to form robust ecosystems.

In general, if the airdrop complies with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is conducted, it can be considered legal.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that airdrops can sometimes fall under securities regulations. If the tokens or assets being distributed qualify as securities, additional requirements may apply. In such cases, issuers need to ensure compliance with securities laws, which may include registration or exemptions from registration.\\n\\nThe legality of airdrops can also depend on the purpose and nature of the distribution. If the airdrop is used to promote a fraudulent scheme or facilitate illegal activities, it can be considered illegal.\\n\\nAdditionally, tax laws may come into play when it comes to airdrops.

Detailed information on each project aids in discerning the airdrop\\'s legitimacy and potential.\\n\\nLastly, follow the explicit claiming instructions tailored for each airdrop. Verifying and confirming transactions might attract network fees; hence, assess the cost-benefit ratio meticulously. In case of questions or uncertainties, reference DappRadar\\'s support resources or community forums for guidance, ensuring an informed claiming process.\\n\\nPrioritize safeguarding your private keys and wallet credentials; treat them with the same diligence as you would your bank account information. Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.\\n\\nAlways verify the authenticity of airdrop sources. Beware of phishing attempts.\\n\\nMonitor activity on your account and set up alerts for unfamiliar transactions. These can be indicative of a breach, allowing you to take immediate action to secure your assets. Vigilance is fundamental in the prevention of unauthorized access and potential losses.\\n\\nExercise caution when connecting your wallet to new platforms. Ensure that the URL of DappRadar is correct before inputting any sensitive information, as malicious websites often mimic legitimate ones. It is advisable to use a hardware wallet for an additional layer of security when participating in airdrops. Remember, the maxim \"if it seems too good to be true, it probably is\" frequently applies to fraudulent or high-risk airdrops.\\n\\nTo get a legitimate airdrop, it is important to follow certain steps and precautions to ensure a safe and authentic experience. Firstly, thoroughly research the project or company offering the airdrop. Check their website, white paper, team members, and community engagement to verify their credibility.\\n\\nNext, be cautious of scams and fake airdrops. Never share your private key or give away sensitive personal information. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for such details. Use caution when clicking on links or providing any personal information online.\\n\\nIt is also advisable to join official announcement channels, social media groups, or forums associated with the project. This will allow you to stay updated and receive official notifications about the airdrop. Avoid unofficial channels or individuals claiming to represent the project, as they may have malicious intentions.\\n\\nRemember to always use a reliable and secure wallet to receive the airdrop tokens. Avoid using exchange wallets, as they may not support all airdrops or have the necessary features to claim them. It is recommended to use a wallet that gives you full control of your private keys.\\n\\nLastly, be patient and follow the instructions provided by the project. Some airdrops may have specific requirements or eligibility criteria. Ensure that you meet these criteria and follow the instructions accurately to receive the airdrop tokens.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can increase your chances of participating in a legitimate airdrop and avoid falling victim to scams or fraudulent schemes. Stay vigilant, do your research, and protect your personal information to ensure a safe and rewarding airdrop experience.\\n\\nHere are some common questions about crypto airdrops and using DappRadar:\\n\\nCrypto airdrops are when blockchain projects distribute free tokens to wallet addresses as a marketing strategy to foster community engagement, widen token distribution, and attract users without upfront costs.\\n\\nCrypto airdrops offer an opportunity to diversify your portfolio, engage with emerging blockchain projects, and potentially earn value from the distributed tokens at no initial cost.\\n\\nDappRadar is a platform that helps users navigate the decentralized space and discover airdrops, track crypto assets, and access analytics to make informed investment decisions.\\n\\nTo register with DappRadar, visit their official website, navigate to the registration or sign-in page, and follow the prompts to create an account.\\n\\nTo link your digital wallet to DappRadar, click on the wallet icon on the platform\\'s interface, choose your wallet provider from the options, and follow the connect request in your wallet to grant permission securely.\\n\\nWhen looking for legitimate airdrops, conduct thorough research on the token and its developers, verify the blockchain presence and community engagement, and use DappRadar\\'s analytical tools to assess their legitimacy.\\n\\nTo claim airdrops through DappRadar, register an account, link your wallet, browse the available airdrops, choose the ones aligned with your investment strategy, and follow the specific claiming instructions provided.\\n\\nTo ensure security, safeguard your wallet credentials, verify airdrop sources for authenticity, monitor account activity, use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA), and exercise caution when connecting your wallet to new platforms.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/1*D62AXCbQzFr6sXNBm1lmuA.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 51, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-397290873', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '15:10:55', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T15:10:55Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T15:04:27Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@nadsonounmom52/how-to-claim-openfabric-ai-ofn-airdrop-detailed-how-to-for-beginners-7a31e6f26dcb', 'title': 'How to Claim Openfabric AI $OFN Airdrop: Detailed How-To for Beginners', 'body': \"An Openfabric AI $OFN airdrop distributes tokens directly to users' wallets, usually free.

Psychology has long played a significant role in UX design, providing insights that help designers predict user interactions and create more intuitive interfaces. By understanding users' cognitive limitations and abilities, as well as managing their cognitive load, designers can develop interfaces that are easy to navigate, reducing frustration and enhancing satisfaction.\\n\\nIn this article, I will delve into the importance of soft skills in UX design, supported by peer-reviewed psychology studies. I will explore how empathy, communication, emotional intelligence, and persuasion, all rooted in psychological principles, are essential for creating user-centered, engaging, and effective designs.\\n\\nEmpathy allows designers to step into the users' shoes, understanding their frustrations and motivations. For example, when designing a healthcare app, an empathetic approach might reveal that users need simple, jargon-free language and quick access to critical features. This understanding results in a design that is not only functional but also comforting and accessible to users who may be stressed or anxious about their health. A study published in the Journal of User Experience found that designers who employ empathetic approaches such as the example above, are better able to anticipate and address user needs and pain points, leading to more effective and satisfying user experiences (Fischer & Hornecker, 2012).\\n\\nIn UX design, clear communication is vital for collaborating with cross-functional teams such as developers and business stakeholders. For instance, when working on a new e-commerce website, a UX designer must effectively communicate user research findings and design rationale to ensure that all team members are aligned with the user-centered goals of the project. This leads to a cohesive and user-friendly final product. Research in the Journal of Applied Psychology shows that effective communication significantly impacts team collaboration and project success (Bakker et al., 2011), showing that clear communication between team members and stakeholders will reduce misunderstandings and errors.\\n\\nEmotional intelligence helps UX designers handle feedback and conflict constructively. For example, during usability testing, a designer with high emotional inteligence will effectively interpret users' non-verbal cues and emotional responses, gaining deeper insights into their experiences. Also in team settings, it will help resolve disagreements and maintain a collaborative atmosphere, ensuring that the project progresses smoothly. A study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that individuals with high emotional intelligence are better at managing interpersonal relationships and navigating social complexities (Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2008).\\n\\nPersuasion is essential when presenting design ideas to stakeholders who may prioritize business goals over user experience. A UX designer can use persuasive techniques to highlight the benefits of a user-centered design, such as increased user satisfaction and long-term customer loyalty. For example, by presenting data from user research and case studies, the designer can convince stakeholders to invest in a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.\\n\\nStudy Insight: A study in the Journal of Consumer Research discusses how persuasive communication can influence decision-making and behavior (Cialdini, 2001). For UX designers, being persuasive means effectively advocating for user needs and justifying design decisions.\\n\\nBy integrating insights from psychology, UX designers can create more user-centered, engaging, and successful products. These skills not only improve the design process but also foster better collaboration and understanding within teams, ultimately leading to more innovative and user-friendly solutions.\", 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/resize:fit:1200/0*Cl-FwdMybI-Mw4Sn', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.3568627450980393, 'wgt': 51, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': 'b-8188963096', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '14:57:28', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T14:57:28Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T14:56:25Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@ld0iqz9ft/how-to-claim-baobaosol-baos-airdrop-quick-guide-and-tips-e277b15c1774', 'title': 'How to Claim BaoBaoSol $BAOS Airdrop: Quick Guide and Tips', 'body': 'Are you ready to delve into the exciting realm of cryptocurrency and explore the phenomenon of BAOS airdrops?

These platforms serve as hubs where users can discover upcoming airdrops, learn about eligibility criteria, and track their airdrop rewards. Furthermore, they provide valuable resources such as manuals and tutorials on how to participate in airdrops effectively.\\n\\nToday, the crypto community eagerly anticipates new airdrop opportunities, viewing them as a chance to diversify their digital asset portfolios and engage with promising projects. The value of airdropped tokens can vary widely, depending on factors such as the project\\'s credibility, market demand, and distribution strategy. Nevertheless, airdrops continue to represent an innovative approach to token distribution and community building within the crypto space.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the history of BAOS airdrops reflects the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency industry.

These tokens may belong to new projects, platforms, or initiatives seeking to gain traction in the crypto sphere. Essentially, it\\'s a promotional strategy aimed at fostering community engagement and increasing the visibility of the respective project.\\n\\nOne significant aspect to consider is the potential effect of BAOS airdrops on the overall market dynamics. These events often lead to an influx of new coins into circulation, which can impact supply and demand dynamics. Depending on the scale and scope of the airdrop, it could influence market sentiment, trading volumes, and even the price of BaoBaoSol $BAOS itself.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that not all BAOS airdrops are created equal. Factors such as the credibility of the issuing project, the terms of the airdrop, and the overall market conditions can significantly affect the outcome. Additionally, participants should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging in any airdrop activities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, BAOS airdrops represent a unique aspect of the crypto ecosystem, with the potential to influence market dynamics in various ways. By analyzing their impact on market sentiment, trading volumes, and BaoBaoSol $BAOS\\'s price, investors can gain valuable insights into the evolving landscape of the crypto market.\\n\\nFor more details on BaoBaoSol $BAOS airdrops and their implications, visit https://url-medium.com/.\\n\\nBaoBaoSol $BAOS airdrops have become a significant phenomenon in the cryptocurrency world, often serving as marketing strategies or community-building initiatives for various blockchain projects. Airdrops involve the distribution of free coins to existing holders of a particular cryptocurrency, rewarding them for their loyalty or incentivizing further engagement. Let\\'s delve into some of the most notable BAOS airdrops that have occurred throughout history.\\n\\nOne of the most famous BAOS airdrops happened in August 2017 when BaoBaoSol $BAOS underwent a hard fork, resulting in the creation of BaoBaoSol $BAOS Cash (BCH). This airdrop occurred as a result of a fundamental disagreement within the BaoBaoSol $BAOS community regarding the scalability of the network. Those holding BaoBaoSol $BAOS at the time of the fork received an equivalent amount of BaoBaoSol $BAOS Cash, effectively doubling their holdings.\\n\\nBaoBaoSol $BAOS Cash aimed to address BaoBaoSol $BAOS\\'s scalability issues by increasing the block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed per block. The airdrop was contentious but ultimately led to the establishment of a separate cryptocurrency with its own community and development team.\\n\\nAnother significant BAOS airdrop took place in October 2017 with the creation of BaoBaoSol $BAOS Gold (BTG). This airdrop occurred through a similar process of hard forking, with the intention of decentralizing BaoBaoSol $BAOS mining by implementing a new mining algorithm.\\n\\nBaoBaoSol $BAOS Gold aimed to make mining more accessible to individual miners by using a different algorithm that was resistant to ASICs, specialized mining hardware. Holders of BaoBaoSol $BAOS received an equivalent amount of BaoBaoSol $BAOS Gold during the airdrop, allowing them to diversify their holdings and participate in a new cryptocurrency project.\\n\\nIn February 2018, BaoBaoSol $BAOS Private (BAOSP) was created through a fork of BaoBaoSol $BAOS and Zclassic. This airdrop aimed to combine the privacy features of Zclassic with the security and familiarity of BaoBaoSol $BAOS. Holders of both BaoBaoSol $BAOS and Zclassic received BaoBaoSol $BAOS Private at a 1:1 ratio.\\n\\nBaoBaoSol $BAOS Private implemented the zk-SNARKs privacy protocol, allowing for anonymous transactions while still maintaining the transparency and security of the BaoBaoSol $BAOS blockchain. The airdrop generated significant interest and participation from both the BaoBaoSol $BAOS and Zclassic communities.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the famous BAOS airdrops that have occurred throughout history. Airdrops continue to be a popular method for distributing new coins and engaging cryptocurrency communities. Whether it\\'s for marketing purposes, network expansion, or community building, airdrops play a significant role in the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in learning more about BAOS airdrops and their impact on the crypto market, you can visit Famous BAOS Airdrops Throughout History.\\n\\nBtc airdrops have become a significant phenomenon in the cryptocurrency space, offering a glimpse into the future of token distribution and community engagement. As the crypto landscape evolves, it\\'s crucial to analyze current trends and make informed predictions about the direction in which Btc airdrops are heading.\\n\\nOne of the key trends shaping the future of Btc airdrops is the emphasis on quality over quantity. In the early days of airdrops, projects often distributed tokens widely to attract attention. However, this approach has led to issues such as token dumping and low engagement. Moving forward, we can expect to see a shift towards targeted airdrops that focus on specific communities or demographics.\\n\\nAnother emerging trend is the integration of airdrops with blockchain technology beyond Ethereum. While Ethereum has been the primary platform for airdrops due to its smart contract capabilities, other blockchains like Btc are gaining traction for token distribution. With innovations such as tokenized layers and interoperability protocols, Btc airdrops are becoming more feasible and efficient.\\n\\nFurthermore, the use of testnets for airdrop campaigns is likely to increase in popularity. Testnets provide a risk-free environment for projects to distribute tokens and gather feedback from users before launching on the mainnet. By leveraging testnets, projects can refine their tokenomics and ensure a smoother rollout of their airdrop.\\n\\nWhen considering the future of Btc airdrops, it\\'s essential to address the issue of user participation. Despite the potential rewards, many users are hesitant to participate in airdrops due to concerns about privacy and security. To overcome this barrier, projects need to implement user-friendly strategies that prioritize transparency and security.\\n\\nIn terms of rewards, we may see a shift towards non-monetary incentives such as access to exclusive features or governance rights. These alternative rewards can create long-term value for participants and foster a sense of community ownership over the project.\\n\\nOn the promotional front, social media platforms like Twitter will continue to play a crucial role in spreading awareness about Btc airdrops. However, projects must devise creative strategies to stand out amidst the noise and capture the attention of their target audience.\\n\\nAs we look ahead, the future of Btc airdrops appears promising but challenging. By staying abreast of industry trends and adopting innovative strategies, projects can maximize the potential of airdrops as a tool for decentralized token distribution and community building.\\n\\nFor more insights on Btc airdrops and the latest developments in the crypto space, visit https://url-medium.com/.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*89V8tMr8zHZrscIUS5rt_w.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 51, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-397093164', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-21', 'time': '12:09:58', 'dateTime': '2024-06-21T12:09:58Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-21T11:51:00Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@rpatech.ai/how-to-make-repetitive-tasks-easier-and-more-efficient-e304c955604d', 'title': 'How to Make Repetitive Tasks Easier and More Efficient', 'body': 'Process automation is a vital component of modern business strategy, involving the application of technology to perform repetitive tasks or processes where manual effort can be substituted.

This technology has been touted as a revolutionary tool that could change not just the world of finance, but the very fabric of the internet itself. The promise of blockchain technology lies in its ability to create a decentralized network of computers that can transfer value without the need for central authorities. This radical shift in how we transfer and store value could potentially disrupt the dominance of Big Tech and usher in a new era of the internet that is more open, inclusive, and aligned with the values of its users.\\n\\nOne of the most distinctive features of blockchain technology is the concept of digital ownership. This revolutionary concept is manifested through the use of tokens, which can be either fungible or non-fungible (NFTs). These tokens represent ownership of a digital asset and can be exchanged, bought, or sold in the same way as physical assets. This new form of digital ownership could redefine the way we think about ownership and exchange in the digital realm, offering new opportunities for creativity, collaboration, and innovation.\\n\\nThe potential applications of blockchain technology are vast and varied. For instance, blockchain could be used to create decentralized virtual worlds, where users can interact and create value in an environment free from central control. It could also enable the creation of user-governed social networks, where users have a say in the rules and operation of the platform. Furthermore, blockchain could facilitate the emergence of fluid, token-based organizations that can adapt and evolve in response to user needs and market dynamics.\\n\\nThis potential future, known as the \"read-write-own\" era, represents a significant shift in how the internet functions. In this new era, the economic benefits and governance rights are spread to the communities of users themselves, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants. This decentralization of power and value could lead to a more equitable and democratic internet, where users have a greater stake in the platforms and communities they contribute to.\\n\\nHowever, the transition to this new era is not without its challenges. One of the most significant is the need to ensure that these new technologies are used responsibly and ethically. Artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, two transformative technologies that are closely linked with blockchain, hold the potential to either elevate or devastate the coming decades of human history. As we navigate this new technological landscape, it is crucial that we approach these developments with a clear understanding of their potential risks and rewards, and strive to ensure that they are used in a way that benefits all of humanity.\\n\\nAnother challenge that we face in this new era is in the realm of marketing. With the rise of artificial intelligence, the quality and relevance of content have become increasingly important. In this new digital landscape, the success of a business or a platform is no longer just about who has the deepest pockets for advertising spend. Rather, it is about who can cleverly use AI to understand and predict their audience\\'s desires and needs, and deliver content that meets these demands.\\n\\nAs we navigate this new technological landscape, we must also be mindful of the potential for bias in both AI and blockchain technology. Just as academic publications can be influenced by certain biases, so too can these new technologies. This is a significant concern, as these technologies have the potential to shape our world in profound and far-reaching ways. We must ensure that these tools are used in a transparent and equitable manner, rather than simply reinforcing existing power structures and inequalities.\\n\\nIn the face of these challenges, it is essential that we remain curious and keep asking questions. We must constantly evaluate the data and statistics we encounter, and ensure that we are not being led astray by misleading or incomplete information. As we interact with these new technologies, we must strive to maintain a critical and informed perspective.\\n\\nOne way to do this is to memorize a few landmark numbers. Having these figures in your head can make it easier to understand the relative significance of other numbers that we encounter. This simple practice can help us to avoid being misled by distorted statistics, and ensure that we have a clear and accurate understanding of the information we encounter.\\n\\nWe must also be aware of the potential for manipulation in the presentation of data. For instance, the definition of terms can be manipulated to distort the facts and advance a particular perspective. Always question the definitions used in a claim before you accept or refute it. This practice can help us to see through misleading arguments and ensure that we have a clear and accurate understanding of the issues at hand.\\n\\nFinally, as we venture into this new era of the internet, we must keep in mind that these new technologies are not just tools, but potential game-changers. They have the potential to radically reshape our world and the way we interact with it. But with this potential comes a responsibility to use these tools wisely and ethically.

This isn\\'t the stuff of distant science fiction; it\\'s on the brink of becoming reality with a revolutionary technology that harnesses the enigmatic principles of quantum mechanics. Introducing the Quantum Communiqué, a device that promises to transform interstellar communication by leveraging the unique properties of quantum entanglement and advanced materials science.\\n\\nAt the heart of this groundbreaking technology are two large, ultra-thin sheets of graphene, each about the size of a standard computer monitor (though in principle any desirable size could be achieved). Graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional lattice, is renowned for its remarkable electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The key innovation lies in the precise manufacturing of these graphene sheets, ensuring they possess an identical number of atoms in an exact 2D matrix. What makes this setup extraordinary is that each atom in these graphene sheets is quantum entangled with its corresponding atom in the other sheet, creating a direct and instantaneous link between the two.\\n\\nOne sheet resides on Earth, within a sophisticated control center, while the other embarks on an interstellar journey aboard a spaceship. When a person speaks in front of the graphene sheet on Earth, the sound waves generate minuscule vibrations on its surface. Thanks to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, these vibrations are instantly mirrored on the distant graphene sheet aboard the spaceship, regardless of the light-years separating them. This instant transmission of information defies the classical constraints of space and time, providing a real-time communication channel that could revolutionize space exploration and beyond.\\n\\nToday\\'s surveillance technology already exploits the subtle vibrations on window panes to eavesdrop on conversations inside buildings. High-precision laser microphones can detect these vibrations and amplify them into audible sound. The Quantum Communiqué employs a similar principle but on a quantum level. When sound waves impact the graphene sheet, they induce atomic-scale vibrations that are detected and translated into usable audio at the other end, thanks to the quantum entanglement between the atoms. This process ensures that communication is not only instantaneous but also incredibly precise and reliable.\\n\\nThe theoretical foundation for this concept is grounded in well-established scientific principles. Quantum entanglement, famously described by Albert Einstein as \"spooky action at a distance,\" has been experimentally validated numerous times. Researchers have demonstrated entanglement over distances exceeding 1,200 kilometers, and advancements in quantum state transmission continue to push these boundaries. Graphene, discovered in 2004, has rapidly become a focal point in materials science due to its exceptional properties and potential applications, including its use in high-speed electronics, sensors, and even quantum devices.\\n\\nIntegrating these cutting-edge advancements, the Quantum Communiqué represents a fusion of quantum physics and nanotechnology. It promises to overcome one of the most daunting challenges in space exploration: the communication delay caused by the vast distances between celestial bodies. As humanity prepares for manned missions to Mars and dreams of venturing even further into the cosmos, the need for reliable, instantaneous communication becomes paramount. This technology not only paves the way for real-time conversations between Earth and spacecraft but also has profound implications for data transmission, remote operations, and the coordination of complex interstellar missions.\\n\\nThe Quantum Communiqué heralds a new era in communication technology, where distance is no longer a barrier. By harnessing the power of quantum entanglement and the remarkable properties of graphene, this device offers a tantalizing glimpse into a future where interstellar communication is as seamless and immediate as a phone call across town, just as we\\'ve become accustomed to through countless sci-fi narratives.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*mdbnKXXcU1ftaBeZZe3h6w.jpeg', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2470588235294118, 'wgt': 51, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-396204879', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '17:01:19', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T17:01:19Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T16:47:36Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@CmusicAI/cmusicai-a-decentralized-blockchain-built-on-kawpow-building-tools-and-marketplaces-for-562120177256', 'title': \"''CmusicAI\\u200a -- \\u200aA decentralized blockchain built on KawPow, building tools and marketplaces for...\", 'body': \"This whitepaper presents CmusicAI, a pioneering platform designed to revolutionize the music industry through the use of blockchain technology.

In case of questions or uncertainties, reference DappRadar\\'s support resources or community forums for guidance, ensuring an informed claiming process.\\n\\nPrioritize safeguarding your private keys and wallet credentials; treat them with the same diligence as you would your bank account information.

Check their website, white paper, team members, and community engagement to verify their credibility.\\n\\nNext, be cautious of scams and fake airdrops. Never share your private key or give away sensitive personal information. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for such details. Use caution when clicking on links or providing any personal information online.\\n\\nIt is also advisable to join official announcement channels, social media groups, or forums associated with the project. This will allow you to stay updated and receive official notifications about the airdrop. Avoid unofficial channels or individuals claiming to represent the project, as they may have malicious intentions.\\n\\nRemember to always use a reliable and secure wallet to receive the airdrop tokens. Avoid using exchange wallets, as they may not support all airdrops or have the necessary features to claim them. It is recommended to use a wallet that gives you full control of your private keys.\\n\\nLastly, be patient and follow the instructions provided by the project. Some airdrops may have specific requirements or eligibility criteria.

Among these are airdrops and forks, both of which can significantly impact the crypto community. Understanding the disparities between these two phenomena is crucial for any crypto enthusiast.\\n\\nImagine waking up one morning to find free tokens of a new cryptocurrency sitting in your digital wallet. That\\'s essentially what an airdrop is -- a method used by crypto projects to distribute free tokens to existing holders of a particular cryptocurrency, such as Metal DAO $MTL.

These tokens may belong to new projects, platforms, or initiatives seeking to gain traction in the crypto sphere. Essentially, it\\'s a promotional strategy aimed at fostering community engagement and increasing the visibility of the respective project.\\n\\nOne significant aspect to consider is the potential effect of MTL airdrops on the overall market dynamics. These events often lead to an influx of new coins into circulation, which can impact supply and demand dynamics. Depending on the scale and scope of the airdrop, it could influence market sentiment, trading volumes, and even the price of Metal DAO $MTL itself.\\n\\nImpact on Market Sentiment:\\n\\nEffect on Trading Volumes:\\n\\nInfluence on Metal DAO $MTL Price:\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that not all MTL airdrops are created equal. Factors such as the credibility of the issuing project, the terms of the airdrop, and the overall market conditions can significantly affect the outcome. Additionally, participants should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging in any airdrop activities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, MTL airdrops represent a unique aspect of the crypto ecosystem, with the potential to influence market dynamics in various ways. By analyzing their impact on market sentiment, trading volumes, and Metal DAO $MTL\\'s price, investors can gain valuable insights into the evolving landscape of the crypto market.\\n\\nFor more details on Metal DAO $MTL airdrops and their implications, visit https://url-medium.com/.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL airdrops have become a significant phenomenon in the cryptocurrency world, often serving as marketing strategies or community-building initiatives for various blockchain projects. Airdrops involve the distribution of free coins to existing holders of a particular cryptocurrency, rewarding them for their loyalty or incentivizing further engagement. Let\\'s delve into some of the most notable MTL airdrops that have occurred throughout history.\\n\\nOne of the most famous MTL airdrops happened in August 2017 when Metal DAO $MTL underwent a hard fork, resulting in the creation of Metal DAO $MTL Cash (BCH). This airdrop occurred as a result of a fundamental disagreement within the Metal DAO $MTL community regarding the scalability of the network. Those holding Metal DAO $MTL at the time of the fork received an equivalent amount of Metal DAO $MTL Cash, effectively doubling their holdings.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL Cash aimed to address Metal DAO $MTL\\'s scalability issues by increasing the block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed per block. The airdrop was contentious but ultimately led to the establishment of a separate cryptocurrency with its own community and development team.\\n\\nAnother significant MTL airdrop took place in October 2017 with the creation of Metal DAO $MTL Gold (BTG). This airdrop occurred through a similar process of hard forking, with the intention of decentralizing Metal DAO $MTL mining by implementing a new mining algorithm.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL Gold aimed to make mining more accessible to individual miners by using a different algorithm that was resistant to ASICs, specialized mining hardware. Holders of Metal DAO $MTL received an equivalent amount of Metal DAO $MTL Gold during the airdrop, allowing them to diversify their holdings and participate in a new cryptocurrency project.\\n\\nIn February 2018, Metal DAO $MTL Private (MTLP) was created through a fork of Metal DAO $MTL and Zclassic. This airdrop aimed to combine the privacy features of Zclassic with the security and familiarity of Metal DAO $MTL. Holders of both Metal DAO $MTL and Zclassic received Metal DAO $MTL Private at a 1:1 ratio.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL Private implemented the zk-SNARKs privacy protocol, allowing for anonymous transactions while still maintaining the transparency and security of the Metal DAO $MTL blockchain. The airdrop generated significant interest and participation from both the Metal DAO $MTL and Zclassic communities.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the famous MTL airdrops that have occurred throughout history. Airdrops continue to be a popular method for distributing new coins and engaging cryptocurrency communities. Whether it\\'s for marketing purposes, network expansion, or community building, airdrops play a significant role in the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in learning more about MTL airdrops and their impact on the crypto market, you can visit Famous MTL Airdrops Throughout History.\\n\\nBtc airdrops have become a significant phenomenon in the cryptocurrency space, offering a glimpse into the future of token distribution and community engagement. As the crypto landscape evolves, it\\'s crucial to analyze current trends and make informed predictions about the direction in which Btc airdrops are heading.\\n\\nOne of the key trends shaping the future of Btc airdrops is the emphasis on quality over quantity. In the early days of airdrops, projects often distributed tokens widely to attract attention. However, this approach has led to issues such as token dumping and low engagement. Moving forward, we can expect to see a shift towards targeted airdrops that focus on specific communities or demographics.\\n\\nAnother emerging trend is the integration of airdrops with blockchain technology beyond Ethereum. While Ethereum has been the primary platform for airdrops due to its smart contract capabilities, other blockchains like Btc are gaining traction for token distribution. With innovations such as tokenized layers and interoperability protocols, Btc airdrops are becoming more feasible and efficient.\\n\\nFurthermore, the use of testnets for airdrop campaigns is likely to increase in popularity. Testnets provide a risk-free environment for projects to distribute tokens and gather feedback from users before launching on the mainnet. By leveraging testnets, projects can refine their tokenomics and ensure a smoother rollout of their airdrop.\\n\\nWhen considering the future of Btc airdrops, it\\'s essential to address the issue of user participation. Despite the potential rewards, many users are hesitant to participate in airdrops due to concerns about privacy and security. To overcome this barrier, projects need to implement user-friendly strategies that prioritize transparency and security.\\n\\nIn terms of rewards, we may see a shift towards non-monetary incentives such as access to exclusive features or governance rights. These alternative rewards can create long-term value for participants and foster a sense of community ownership over the project.\\n\\nOn the promotional front, social media platforms like Twitter will continue to play a crucial role in spreading awareness about Btc airdrops. However, projects must devise creative strategies to stand out amidst the noise and capture the attention of their target audience.\\n\\nAs we look ahead, the future of Btc airdrops appears promising but challenging. By staying abreast of industry trends and adopting innovative strategies, projects can maximize the potential of airdrops as a tool for decentralized token distribution and community building.\\n\\nFor more insights on Btc airdrops and the latest developments in the crypto space, visit https://url-medium.com/.', 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*89V8tMr8zHZrscIUS5rt_w.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.2392156862745098, 'wgt': 51, 'relevance': 51}, {'uri': 'b-2024-06-395874310', 'lang': 'eng', 'isDuplicate': False, 'date': '2024-06-20', 'time': '12:11:40', 'dateTime': '2024-06-20T12:11:40Z', 'dateTimePub': '2024-06-20T11:58:28Z', 'dataType': 'blog', 'sim': 0, 'url': 'https://medium.com/@zmagribiruni/how-to-claim-venom-airdrops-using-defi-wallets-ed247386446c', 'title': 'How to Claim Venom Airdrops Using DeFi Wallets', 'body': \"Throughout this comprehensive guide, I will unravel the intricacies of Venom $VENOM Airdrops, providing you with a step-by-step roadmap to unlock their full potential.

Moreover, engage with the community and developers through social media channels to obtain a holistic understanding of the project\\'s value proposition and roadmap.\\n\\nBeware of any red flags signaling fraud.\\n\\nAnticipate and recognize indications of a duplicitous airdrop.

Throughout this step-by-step engagement, it is paramount to adhere closely to the details relayed by DappRadar, as precise actions are often required to successfully secure the airdropped tokens.\\n\\nIt is imperative to initiate the process by registering an account on DappRadar, thus ensuring access to comprehensive airdrop listings and analytics.

This step bridges your assets and potential airdrops.\\n\\nNext, proceed to the \\'Airdrops\\' section and meticulously analyze available offerings. Apply discretion -- opting for airdrops aligning with your investment strategy. Detailed information on each project aids in discerning the airdrop\\'s legitimacy and potential.\\n\\nLastly, follow the explicit claiming instructions tailored for each airdrop. Verifying and confirming transactions might attract network fees; hence, assess the cost-benefit ratio meticulously. In case of questions or uncertainties, reference DappRadar\\'s support resources or community forums for guidance, ensuring an informed claiming process.\\n\\nPrioritize safeguarding your private keys and wallet credentials; treat them with the same diligence as you would your bank account information. Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.\\n\\nAlways verify the authenticity of airdrop sources. Beware of phishing attempts.\\n\\nMonitor activity on your account and set up alerts for unfamiliar transactions. These can be indicative of a breach, allowing you to take immediate action to secure your assets. Vigilance is fundamental in the prevention of unauthorized access and potential losses.\\n\\nExercise caution when connecting your wallet to new platforms. Ensure that the URL of DappRadar is correct before inputting any sensitive information, as malicious websites often mimic legitimate ones. It is advisable to use a hardware wallet for an additional layer of security when participating in airdrops. Remember, the maxim \"if it seems too good to be true, it probably is\" frequently applies to fraudulent or high-risk airdrops.\\n\\nTo get a legitimate airdrop, it is important to follow certain steps and precautions to ensure a safe and authentic experience. Firstly, thoroughly research the project or company offering the airdrop. Check their website, white paper, team members, and community engagement to verify their credibility.\\n\\nNext, be cautious of scams and fake airdrops. Never share your private key or give away sensitive personal information. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for such details. Use caution when clicking on links or providing any personal information online.\\n\\nIt is also advisable to join official announcement channels, social media groups, or forums associated with the project. This will allow you to stay updated and receive official notifications about the airdrop. Avoid unofficial channels or individuals claiming to represent the project, as they may have malicious intentions.\\n\\nRemember to always use a reliable and secure wallet to receive the airdrop tokens. Avoid using exchange wallets, as they may not support all airdrops or have the necessary features to claim them. It is recommended to use a wallet that gives you full control of your private keys.\\n\\nLastly, be patient and follow the instructions provided by the project. Some airdrops may have specific requirements or eligibility criteria. Ensure that you meet these criteria and follow the instructions accurately to receive the airdrop tokens.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can increase your chances of participating in a legitimate airdrop and avoid falling victim to scams or fraudulent schemes.

Nothing strange, right? Well, there is something special in that card. The card was made from seed paper which took my attention and I wanted to know more about it. More interesting was the comment section of post where there was a nice Q/A session between two experts of this technology. You can check it out. Well, here is what my research over Seed paper yields. Before this, a round of applause for Mr. Shubham Gupta for taking this initiative.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, how old is seed paper technology? Many of you would be surprised to know that it was first used in 1400s and hence, the technology is not new. But yes, they were just simply out of sight till early 2000s.It was only in the early 2000s that this technology got importance due to increasing environmental concerns.\\n\\nSeed paper is nothing other than that its name suggests, just a paper embedded with seeds in it. The idea is that these seed papers after use, when discarded can germinate into plants. This idea in itself makes it eco-friendly, as it will -1) degrade easily, its biodegradable 2) Will germinate into plant which leads to increase in green cover.\\n\\nYou might be thinking of how these papers are even manufactured. So, basically during the pulping process, the original raw material from making paper is mixed with seeds and then they are turned into sheets of paper.\\n\\nBut is everything so good? Idea is brilliant but the problem lies in execution. Middle school science teaches us that for seeds to germinate, they need soil, air and water. So, for the idea of seed paper to work, seed papers must be discarded with proper care and should be planted in pots or garden with regular water supply. If anything goes wrong with execution, then no point of this brilliant idea.\\n\\nNext concern about seed paper is its production cost. Due to additional raw material and additional processing, manufacturing cost for seed papers is higher than traditional paper. Hence, seed paper industry faces competition from traditional paper industry. As the costs are high, most people are not willing to pay extra just for an environmental cause. Hence, here comes the need of individual engagement or government interference in the market by subsidizing this industry or any other incentives.\\n\\nEven though, seed papers are gaining popularity due to increasing environmental concerns, but still, they just account for a very less percentage of paper market. Hence, there is a need for growing awareness.\\n\\ncan we even use these seed papers for making notebooks? OR Is any Company currently using seed papers to manufacture notebooks? So, the answer is yes. Seed paper can be used to make cover pages, packaging material and visiting cards and other stuffs. Yes, there are a few companies, mostly based in North America and Europe which are using seed Paper Technology. Some of the Examples are Plantables, EcoEnclose, Botanical Paper Works and Bloomin. If you also want a plant able visiting card for your office, check out these companies.\\n\\nHaving analyzed seed paper market, it's less market share, reasons behind market share, idea of seed paper and manufacturing process of seed papers. Lastly comes the fact that how feasible are these seed papers? What is their Germination rate? So, the germination rate for these seed papers varies and depends on type of seed, quality of seed paper, environmental conditions and handling of seed papers. As a rough estimate, we can assume germination rate of these seed papers to 60-80% according to ChatGPT.\\n\\nConclusion: Yes, Seed papers are sustainable and can prove to be great marvel for environment considering huge scale deforestation. But there are some conditions which need to be followed like proper handling of seed paper and properly planting these papers after use. Apart from this, government need to step in with subsidies and incentives.\", 'source': {'uri': 'medium.com', 'dataType': 'blog', 'title': 'Medium.com'}, 'authors': [], 'image': 'https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*kFrc4tBFM_tCis-2Ic87WA.png', 'eventUri': None, 'sentiment': 0.1764705882352942, 'wgt': 51, 'relevance': 51}]}, 'topicPage': {'uri': 'be2534a5-e15e-42d8-b939-dcba8269a85c', 'autoAddArticles': True, 'visibility': 0, 'maxDaysBack': 1, 'restrictToSetConcepts': True, 'restrictToSetKeywords': False, 'restrictToSetCategories': False, 'restrictToSetSources': True, 'restrictToSetLocations': False, 'articleTreshWgt': 0, 'eventTreshWgt': 0, 'articleIsDuplicate': 'skipDuplicates', 'articleHasDuplicate': 'keepAll', 'articleHasEvent': 'keepAll', 'startSourceRankPercentile': 0, 'endSourceRankPercentile': 100, 'minSentiment': 0, 'maxSentiment': 1, 'minSocialScore': 0, 'minArticlesInEvent': 0, 'concepts': [{'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence', 'wgt': 30}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning', 'wgt': 30}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology', 'wgt': 30}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning', 'wgt': 30}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research', 'wgt': 30}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model', 'wgt': 30}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugging_Face', 'wgt': 50}], 'keywords': [{'keyword': 'LLM', 'wgt': 50}, {'keyword': 'language model', 'wgt': 50}, {'keyword': 'pretrained', 'wgt': 50}], 'categories': [{'uri': 'dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence', 'wgt': 30}], 'sources': [{'uri': 'medium.com', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'analyticsvidhya.com', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'towardsdatascience.com', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'towardsdatascience.medium.com', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'blogs.nvidia.com', 'wgt': 50}, {'uri': 'huggingface.co', 'wgt': 50}], 'locations': [], 'sourceLocations': [], 'sourceGroups': [], 'langs': ['eng']}}\n"

       "    'title': 'Understanding Techniques for Solving GenAI Challenges',\n",
       "    'body': 'Generative AI adoption is rapidly increasing for both individuals and businesses. A recent Gartner study found that GenAI solutions are the number one AI solution used by organizations, with most companies leveraging GenAI features built into existing tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot. In my experience, most businesses are looking for some sort of \"private ChatGPT\" they can use to get more value from their unique organizational data. Company goals vary from finding information in particular documents, generating reports based on tabular data, and summarizing content, to finding all the projects related to some domain, and much more.\\n\\nThis article explores various approaches to solve these problems, outlining the pros, cons, and applications of each. My goal is to provide guidance on when to consider different approaches and how to combine them for the best outcomes, covering everything from the most complex and expensive approaches like pre-training to the simplest, most cost-effective techniques like prompt engineering.\\n\\nThe sequence of the article is intended to build from the foundational concepts for model training (pre-training, continued pre-training, and fine tuning) to the more commonly understood techniques (RAG and prompt engineering) for interacting with existing models.\\n\\nThere is no one-size fits all approach to tackling GenAI problems. Most use cases require a combination of techniques to achieve successful outcomes. Typically, organizations start with a model like GPT-4, Llama3 70b Instruct, or DBRX Instruct which have been pretrained on trillions of tokens to perform next token prediction, then fine-tuned for a particular task, like instruction or chat. Instruction based models are trained and optimized to follow specific directions given in the prompt while chat based models are trained and optimized to handle conversational formats over multiple turns, maintaining context and coherence throughout the conversation.\\n\\nUsing existing models allows organizations to take advantage of the significant time and financial investments made by companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Databricks to curate datasets, create innovative architectures, and train and evaluate their models.\\n\\nAlthough not every company will need to pre-train or instruction fine-tune their models, anyone using a Large Language Model (LLM) benefits from the groundwork laid by these industry leaders. This foundation allows other companies to address their unique challenges without starting from scratch.\\n\\nIn the following sections, we\\'ll explore pre-training, fine-tuning (both instruction fine-tuning, and continued pre-training), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning embeddings for RAG, and prompt engineering, discussing how and when each of these approaches should be used or considered.\\n\\nOverview: Pre-Training a model creates a foundation which will be used as a base for all downstream tasks. This process includes defining the architecture for the model, curating a massive dataset (generally trillions of tokens), training the model, and evaluating its performance. In the context of LLMs and SLMs, the pre-training phase is used to inject knowledge into the model, enabling it to predict the next word or token in a sequence. For instance, in the sentence \"the cat sat on the ___\", the model learns to predict \"mat\".\\n\\nCompanies like OpenAI have invested heavily in the pre-training phase for their GPT models, but since models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o are closed source it is not possible to use the underlying architecture and pre-train the model on a different dataset with different parameters. However, with resources like Mosaic AI\\'s pre-training API it is possible to pre-train open source models like DBRX.\\n\\nApplications: Generally, pre-training your own model is only necessary if none of the other approaches are sufficient for your use case. For example, if you wanted to train a model to understand a new language it has no previous exposure to, you may consider pre-training it then fine-tuning it for your intended use.\\n\\nOnce the base training is complete, the models typically need to be fine-tuned so that they can perform tasks effectively. When you see a model labeled as a chat or instruct model, that indicates the base model has been fine-tuned for either of those purposes. Nearly any model you interact with today has been fine-tuned for one of these purposes so that end users can interact with the model efficiently.\\n\\nGiven the incredible cost and intensive process required to pre-train a model, most organizations decide to leverage existing models in their GenAI use cases. To get started with pretraining, check out Mosaic AI\\'s pretraining API, this allows you to pretrain a Databricks DBRX model with different parameter sizes.\\n\\nOverview: CPT is a type of fine-tuning that allows extends the knowledge of an existing model rather than training the entire model from scratch. The output of a model that\\'s gone through CPT will still predict the next token. In general it\\'s recommended that you use CPT then Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) this way you can extend the model\\'s knowledge first, then tune it to a particular task like following instructions or chat. If done in the reverse order, the model may forget instructions that it learned during the IFT phase.\\n\\nApplications: For industries with highly domain specific content like healthcare or legal, CPT may be a great option for introducing new topics to the model. With tools like Mosaic AI\\'s Fine-Tuning API you can easily get started with CPT, all you need is a series of text files you want to use for training. For the CPT process, all the text files will be concatenated with a separation token between each of the documents, Mosaic handles the complexity behind the scenes for how these files get fed to the model for training.\\n\\nAs an example, let\\'s say we used CPT with a series of text files about responsible AI and AI policies. If I prompt the model to \"Tell me three principles important to Responsible AI\", I would likely get a response with a high probability to follow the sentence I prompted like \"I need to understand the key Responsible AI principles so I can train an effective model\". Although this response is related to my prompt, it does not directly answer the question. This demonstrates the need for IFT to refine the models instruction following capabilities.\\n\\nOverview: IFT is used to teach a model how to perform a particular task. It typically requires thousands of examples and can be used for a specific purpose such as improving question answering, extracting key information, or adopting a certain tone.\\n\\nApplications: IFT helps the model perform particular tasks like question answering much better. Using the prompt \"Tell me three principles important to Responsible AI\", a model that had undergone IFT would likely respond with an answer to the question like \"Responsible AI is critical for ensuring the ethical use of models grounded in core principles like transparency, fairness, and privacy. Following responsible AI principles helps align the solution with broader societal values and ethical standards\". This response is more useful to the end user compared to a response that may come from a CPT or PT model only since it addresses the question directly.\\n\\nNote that there are a variety of fine-tuning approaches and techniques designed to improve the overall model performance and reduce both time and cost associated with training.\\n\\nOverview: RAG enables language models to answer questions using information outside of their training data. In the RAG process, a user query triggers a retrieval of relevant information from a vector index, which is then integrated into a new prompt along with the original query to generate a response. This technique is one of the most common techniques used today due to its effectiveness and simplicity.\\n\\nApplications: Any use case involving question and answering over a set of documents will typically involve RAG. It\\'s a very practical way to get started with Generative AI and requires no additional model training. The emerging concept of AI Agents also tend to have at least one tool for RAG. Many agent implementations will have RAG based tools for different data sources. For example, an internal support agent might have access to an HR tool and IT support tool. In this set-up there could be a RAG component for both the HR and IT documents, each tool could have the same pipeline running behind the scenes, the only difference would be the document dataset.\\n\\nOverview: Fine-Tuning Embeddings can improve the retrieval component of RAG. The goal of fine-tuning embeddings is to push the vector embeddings further apart in the vector space, making them more different from one another and therefore easier to find the documents most relevant to the question.\\n\\nApplications: Fine-tuning embeddings is a great option if the traditional RAG approach is not effective because the documents in your index are too similar to one another. By fine-tuning the embeddings you can teach the model to differentiate better between domain specific concepts and improve your RAG results.\\n\\nOverview: Prompt engineering is the most common way to interact with Generative AI models, it is merely sending a message to the model that\\'s designed to get the output you want. It can be as simple as \"Tell me a story about a German Shepherd\" or it can be incredibly complicated with particular details regarding what you\\'d like the model to do.\\n\\nApplications: Prompt Engineering will be used in combination with all of the aforementioned techniques to produce the intended response. There are many different techniques for prompt engineering to help steer the model in the right direction. For more information on these techniques I recommend this Prompt Engineering Guide from Microsoft they give a variety of examples from Chain-of-Thought prompting and beyond.\\n\\nGenerative AI technology is changing and improving everyday. Most applications will require leveraging a variety of the techniques described in this article. Getting started with existing language models that have been fine-tuned for instruction or chat capabilities and focusing on prompt engineering and RAG is a great place to start! From here finding more tailored use cases that require fine-tuning/instruction fine-tuning can provide even greater benefits.\\n\\nLooking ahead, AI agents offer a promising way to take advantage of the latest advancements in both closed and open-source models that have been pre-trained on tons of public data and fine-tuned for chat/instruction following. When given the right tools, these agents can perform incredible tasks on your behalf from information retrieval with RAG to helping plan company events or vacations.\\n\\nAdditionally, we can expect to see a proliferation of more domain specific models as organizations with lots of specialized data begin pre-training their own models. For instance, companies like Harvey are already developing tailored AI solutions that can handle the unique demands of the legal industry. This trend will likely continue, leading to highly specialized models that deliver even more precise and relevant results in various fields.\\n\\nBy combining the strengths of different AI techniques and leveraging the power of AI agents and domain-specific models, organizations can unlock the full potential of Generative AI.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Securing the AI Supply Chain',\n",
       "    'body': 'While some are already predicting the end of the AI hype cycle, organizations across the globe are prioritizing AI implementation due to its vast potential, as well as enormous market pressures to leverage AI. Nvidia\\'s recent dethroning of Microsoft as the world\\'s valuable company illustrates the global demand for AI, and the chips needed to enable it. Ever since ChatGPT disrupted the market, there has been an especially strong pressure to integrate Generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, CLAUDE, Mistral, Google Gemini, and LLAMA.\\n\\nAs often happens with new technologies, market pressures are seemingly pushing security to the backburner in the C-suite. AI introduces a new form of third-party risk, with a supply chain consisting of the data inputs, outputs, and the model itself, each of which requires security assessments and considerations. For instance, researchers discovered over 100 malicious AI models on the popular, open-source AI platform, Hugging Face. There also are privacy and IP risks if sensitive data is disclosed through AI-assisted chat services, making it accessible to the company producing the technology, or to hackers who have found side channels into the data. Researchers have also demonstrated the ability to spread data-stealing prompt injection worms through large language model (LLM)-powered email assistants.\\n\\nDespite these risks, AI is foundational to the ongoing digital revolution and organizations who fail to securely leverage AI will likely be left behind. The AI arms race is underway, and like most technologies, AI is dual-use. Malicious hackers from China, Russia, and Iran are leveraging AI to enhance their cyberattacks. Businesses are also locked in an AI arms race, an extremely expensive one at that, due to the potential upsides. However, to fully reap the full potential of AI, security must not be an afterthought. AI security must be elevated and integrated into broader third-party risk strategies and processes for organizations to truly reap the benefits and minimize the risks of this foundational technology driving a era-defining technological revolution.\\n\\nThis may seem like a simple question, but there is minimal agreement on the definition of artificial intelligence (AI). For many, AI evokes images of futuristic robots with innate human intelligence. In reality, AI is increasingly viewed as an umbrella term that describes computational systems that leverage inputs (i.e., data) to autonomously produce outputs (e.g., recommendations, predictions, correlations, etc.). Astro Teller, the co-founder and CEO of X (Alphabet\\'s moonshot factory), summarizes AI as algebra on steroids.\\n\\nGiven the lack of consensus on an AI definition, it is most practical to lean on the legal landscape. On the regulatory front, the European Union\\'s Artificial Intelligence Act (E.U. AI Act) defines an AI system as, \"a machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment and that, for explicit and implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.\"\\n\\nThe E.U. Act defines risk as well, noting the probability of harm and its severity. Foundationally, the E.U. AI Act was introduced to minimize potential harm from AI systems, a topic which is growing in awareness in sync with the omnipresence of AI systems. It is just one example of the elevated awareness of the potential harm resulting from AI systems.\\n\\nIn the U.S., NIST similarly defines AI based on machine-driven automation. The AI Risk Management Framework refers to an AI system as an engineered or machine-based system that can, for a given set of objectives, generate outputs such as predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Both the US and EU definitions build upon the OECD\\'s recommendations for AI systems, with a consistent focus on systems designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy.\\n\\nWhen looking to global standards, the ISO/IEC 22989:2022 views AI as, \"a technical and scientific field devoted to the engineered system that generates outputs such as content, forecasts, recommendations or decisions for a given set of human-defined objectives.\" Within the open-source security community, OWASP is an authoritative cybersecurity source and defines AI, \"a broad term that encompasses all fields of computer science that enable machines to accomplish tasks that would normally require human intelligence. Machine learning and generative AI are two subcategories of AI.\"\\n\\nThese all have in common a focus on machine-driven outputs, but fail to elevate data as part of the definition. Of course, the importance of the data is generally introduced throughout the various regulations and standards, but the lack of inclusion of data in core definitions highlights the broader narrative around AI which often ignores data quality and security risks. For simplicity\\'s sake, we can view these potential risk vectors based on the core components of the AI system: the input, model, and output.\\n\\nManipulation of AI systems is not a new phenomenon, but it takes on broader implications thanks to corporate pressures to integrate GenAI. This manipulation is often viewed under the umbrella of adversarial machine learning, which refers to extracting information about the characteristics of an ML system and/or the manipulation of inputs into an ML system to obtain a preferred outcome. In the context of LLMs, OWASP compiled a top ten risks for LLM applications, such as model theft, supply chain vulnerabilities, and data poisoning. CSO Online largely agrees, and specifies prompt injection, prompt extraction, poisoned models and phishing as the top risks of LLMs. Machine learning is one form of AI, but these concerns are relevant across the broad class of AI systems.\\n\\nData Inputs/Training Data\\n\\nThe old data science adage of \\'garbage-in, garbage out\\' is extremely relevant when discussing the role of data in AI systems. As a Harvard Business Review article succinctly noted, \"poor data quality is enemy number 1 to the widespread, profitable use of machine learning.\" AI models are impacted twice by poor data quality, first in the model training on historical data and then again if the new data is used for future decisions. If the inputs into the AI system are compromised, then any courses of action taken are equally compromised. Data poisoning -- or the intentional manipulation of training data going into an AI system -- is especially relevant for third-party risk when the data going into an AI system is from a third-party and openly accessible.\\n\\nThe risk of data poisoning is especially concerning in the large language models (LLMs) powering many of the GenAI capabilities, because they inherently include both the training data and the algorithms. Many researchers have already warned of data manipulation that could lead to misinformation or IP theft in open-sourced GenAI models. A malicious payload could also be uploaded to a training set and triggered once deployed through a series of questions or prompts. In this manner, training data poisoning serves as a backdoor to introduce flaws, vulnerabilities, or other manipulations to the model.\\n\\nIn fact, this does not just occur by attackers but is also a means by which some artists are attempting to defend their intellectual property that they believe was used for training without consent. A tool named Nightshade was created specifically for this purpose, created by the University of Chicago to protect digital artwork from AI-replication or misuse.\\n\\nModel Corruption\\n\\nJust as the data corruption is a growing concern, so too is algorithm corruption. As mentioned earlier, over 100 poisoned models were discovered on the Hugging Face AI platform alone. Model corruption or poisoning reflects another potential AI supply chain risk that enables attackers to potentially inject malicious code through openly available models.\\n\\nThe PyTorch compromise is another example. PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework used to create deep neural networks and expedite development and deployment. In 2022, one of PyTorch\\'s libraries was compromised when a malicious package was uploaded to the code repository bearing the same name as a trusted package. Often referred to as dependency confusion, a malicious package is registered with the same name as a trusted third-party software library, misleading users into believing it is credible. In this case, the seemingly trusted package collected system information and read files and then exfiltrated the data.\\n\\nIn both attacks, machine learning model repositories provided the means by which attackers inserted malicious code. As one security engineer summarized, \"Machine learning pipelines are a brand new supply chain attack vector and companies need to look at what analysis and sandboxing they are doing to protect themselves. ML models are not pure functions. They are full-blown malware vectors ripe for exploit.\"\\n\\nCollaboration platforms such as HuggingFace and GitHub are essential for model implementation, but the security tends to lag behind user adoption. In early 2024, two researchers were able to exploit GitHub\\'s default settings by becoming a repository contributor and introducing backdoors and malicious code. These kinds of CI/CD misconfigurations reflect an additional attack vector and supply chain attack where a fork in a public repository could potentially introduce malicious code onto self-hosted machines.\\n\\nModel Output\\n\\nFinally, model output also can be corrupted, with prompt injection attacks a growing concern as LLMs become embedded in corporate and personal life. Prompt injection attacks reflect an additional form of AI supply chain compromise wherein finely targeted prompts manipulate the model output. The U.K.\\'s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a warning in August 2023 about prompt injection attacks, noting that while the LLM technology is exciting, our understanding is still \\'beta\\'. They recommend users to proceed with caution given the numerous examples of prompts being used to manipulate output and reveal sensitive data, provide harmful guidance, and/or produce biased output.\\n\\nPrompts can be used to subvert any guardrails in place, tricking models to reveal information, such as email content, and have been used to demonstrate security flaws in the most widely used GenAI tools. For instance, researchers have been able to jailbreak OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT and Google Gemini, through a series of prompts that can subvert the guardrails in place to leak personally identifiable information, and restrictions on content and language.\\n\\nData leaks are an additional security risk associated with model outputs and can occur through numerous vectors. Researchers found several vulnerabilities in the open-source AI framework Ray undergoing active exploitation, and all but one were fixed. The final vulnerability was disputed and never fixed, allowing attackers to manipulate the data and models so that they can control a company\\'s computing power and leak sensitive data. Companies from education to healthcare to video analytics have been impacted.\\n\\nRay AI is not alone. Anthropic experienced a data leak when a contractor sent names and accounts receivables files to an unauthorized third-party. These kinds of leaks are not limited to AI systems, but rather reflect general third-party risk when sharing sensitive data. Similarly, a GitHub repository used for AI models and image recognition was not secured, accidentally leaking 38TB of data. This again is not limited to AI models but more so reflective of broader third-party data risks.\\n\\nHowever, there are new data leak concerns that are unique to AI and LLMs. Because many GenAI tools save a user\\'s chat history, if sensitive data or IP are disclosed in any of the prompts, those companies, in turn, can access that sensitive data. For highly regulated industries like the financial industry, this introduces additional regulatory risks by exposing sensitive financial information. In fact, in a poll of U.K. CISOS, 1 in 5 CISOS believe their staff have leaked sensitive information via a GenAI tool. Samsung banned ChatGPT after source code and meetings notes were leaked in the platform.\\n\\nRegulatory environment and risks\\n\\nAs referenced earlier, the E.U. AI Actis the world\\'s first comprehensive AI regulation. It was approved in March 2024, introducing some of the most stringent guardrails around the use of AI. Following in the footsteps of the GDPR, even though it is a European regulation, if a company operates in or sells to European consumers, the ban applies. The E.U. Act creates a tiered system of use cases, with unacceptable risk scenarios susceptible up to $35M euros, or 7% of the company\\'s global turnover in fines. Prohibited uses of AI include biometric classification for socio-economic inference and identification, social scoring systems, and influencing behavior in harmful ways.\\n\\nThe E.U. Act also includes provisions specifically for GenAI, requiring companies to provide summaries of the data used to train the models and follow E.U. copyright law. For those that may cause \\'systemic risk\\', there will be extra vigilance, with OpenAI and Google Gemini included in that category. They also must disclose how much energy their models use, reflecting increased attention on the links between computational energy consumption and climate concerns. Companies will have two years to comply once passed.\\n\\nIn the U.S., the October 2023 executive order (EO) on AI is the first major federal policy push toward AI regulation. The EO similarly takes a risk-based approach, requiring the publication of red-teaming safety results for foundational models that may impact critical areas such as national security and public health. It also aims to address disinformation risks by introducing watermarks to clearly identify any AI-generated content and directs additional research to focus on preventing bias and discrimination, and protecting privacy. While it largely focuses on risks, the EO also offers guidelines for innovation, including the use of AI for cyber defenses, prioritizing privacy-preserving technologies, transforming education, and specifying actions aimed at creating the foundation for the U.S. to be a global leader in AI.\\n\\nWhile the EO reflects progress toward a federal approach, the policy gap remains as AI permeates all aspects of society. In the meantime, many states are introducing their own AI laws, creating a patchwork of challenges for corporate compliance. The New York state bills (S7623 and A9315) are among the more prominent, augmenting the July 2023 law that requires companies to audit their AI systems used in hiring. The new proposals would take further steps toward transparency and require bias audits of AI systems. California law makers may not be far behind, with their own proposals working their way through the legislature. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) also has called for audits and transparency to push companies toward trustworthy AI systems.\\n\\nA similar picture is emerging globally. Brazil may well be the first political system wherein a regulation was written entirely by GenAI. Since then, Brazil has introduced new legislation focused on AI, and is one of at least eight countries in Latin America who have introduced AI laws. Canada has also introduced the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (2023), while China\\'s Generative AI Services Law, South Korea\\'s proposed AI Liability Act, and Indonesia\\'s Governance of Artificial Intelligence and Regulations reflect the evolving regulatory landscape in Asia. Finally, in Africa, Nigeria is creating a national AI strategy while Kenya has proposed an AI bill, among the many ongoing shifts in that region.\\n\\nInternational governmental organizations are introducing new voluntary standards, such ISO 42001, aimed at the responsible development of AI, focusing on transparency and ethical considerations. Importantly, it takes a whole-of-organization approach, highlighting the necessity for leadership commitment toward responsible AI. The United Nations is stepping into AI guidance by adopting a resolution focused on safe and secure systems while focusing on a sustainable development angle. This is essential given that the pressures to integrate AI largely trump security considerations, exposing companies to range of data security and privacy risks.\\n\\nWith AI technologies and policy responses seemingly changing by the day, it is difficult to know how to prepare for today, let alone how to be resilient against upcoming advances. Fortunately, there are several authoritative sources to help organizations optimize the gains and capabilities of AI while also minimizing both the policy and security risks.\\n\\nFor instance, the NIST Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0) offers guidelines on how to achieve trustworthiness in your AI systems. Consistent with the emerging global regulations, AI RMF 1.0 highlights: 1) identification of context to inform risk tolerance; 2) measure, track, and assess identified risks; and 3) prioritize and act on identified risks based on impact. All of these are part of building a culture of AI governance within an organization. NIST provides very detailed breakdowns across each of these areas and is highly recommended reading for organizations seeking secure and trustworthy AI, while complying with existing and forthcoming regulations.\\n\\nAI RMF 1.0 builds upon existing frameworks, such as the OECD Framework for the Classification of AI systems. The White House has also produced the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights, which focuses on safety and security, as well as mitigating biases, privacy concerns, and opt out capabilities (when relevant). There also have been more industry-specific guidelines, such as the US Department of Treasury\\'s report Managing Artificial Intelligence -Specific Cybersecurity Risks in the Financial Services Sector. The report recommends that financial institutions should strengthen their risk management practices by integrating AI systems as part of their frameworks. The report explains, \"it is very likely that often overlooked third-party risk considerations such as data integrity and data provenance will emerge as significant concerns for third-party risk management.\"\\n\\nThese frameworks are a good first step at creating an organization-wide culture of security when it comes to AI. They understandably focus on the processes, but do not go deep on technology. Fortunately, the security industry again has guidelines on that front. The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) created the LLM AI Cybersecurity & Governance Checklist based upon their three pillars of reliable, resilient, and responsible systems. Their guidelines include several areas familiar to those working in cybersecurity, such as red teaming, security and privacy training, asset inventory and an AI RACI chart for governance. They also include Model Cards and Risk Cards that detail information about the model architecture, training data, performance metrics, and potential biases or limitations.\\n\\nResearchers are also moving quickly to create new defenses against these threats. Many focus on defending against prompt injection attacks, such as spotlighting to detect multiple sources of input, structured queries that separate prompts and data, and information hierarchies that define how the model should behave when given conflicting priorities. AI systems are also benefitting from the evolution of MLSecOps and elevating security within the development pipeline. This helps organizations safeguard against supply chain vulnerabilities introduced by AI systems. There also are relevant analogies from SBOM and HBOMs with the emergence of MLBOMs (or AIBOMs). MLBOMs track names, locations, versions, as well as information and meta-data including ownership and requirements.\\n\\nFinally, there are two additional risk considerations when deploying AI systems at the enterprise level: the financial and environmental impact. The cutting-edge chips required to deploy AI are in short-supply, and GenAI models can cost billions to train and maintain. While the costs may hinder some adoption of AI, the environmental impact of AI is also drawing attention, which could potentially introduce ESG risks as well. Due to minimizing energy costs and achieving greater data accuracy, organizations are exploring small language models for greater optimization and efficiencies.\\n\\nThe AI hype cycle persists, with companies that emphasize AI being rewarded with financial benefits. The vast potential of AI introduces significant opportunities for improvements across all aspects of society. However, like most technologies, there also are significant risks associated with AI, which have largely been cast aside in the mad rush to implement AI-driven systems.\\n\\nFortunately, existing third-party risk processes are applicable to AI systems as well, especially when viewed through an AI supply chain lens. Despite corporate pressures, organizations must take a more nuanced approach to AI that integrates risk management as part of the broader AI strategy. This not only will help ensure more secure and robust AI systems, but organizations who implement these policies now will be better prepared for the imminent regulatory changes emerging across the globe.',\n",

       "    'body': 'A large part of my past five weeks was spent attending the course Mastering LLMs: A Conference For Developers & Data Scientists, excellently conducted by Dan Becker and Hamel Husain, with many expert guest speakers sharing their experiences about working with LLM applications in production. There was a special focus on LLM finetuning, which can be used to overcome the limitations of prompt engineering and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in certain cases. The instructors shared that because it is resource and label intensive, finetuning should be used carefully and some of the reasons to perform finetuning are:\\n\\nAfter completing the course, I was dying to finetune my own LLM, but I didn\\'t have a use case. Then, an idea came to my mind: \"Why not I finetune an LLM to talk like me and create a chatbot out of it?\" I can then let it talk to my wife, my kids, and my friends, and I would have so much more free time!\\n\\nFortunately, this use case fulfils the three conditions :\\n\\nAnd so, the project went underway!\\n\\nThe most important thing in any Data Science or Machine Learning project is the data. How is my LLM going to learn to talk like me? Since my wife is going to be one of the main users of this chatbot, my data source has to contain many conversations between me and my wife, for the LLM to learn properly. WhatsApp is my main mode of communications, and most of my conversations with my wife take place there. Thus, I exported our WhatsApp chat to use as training data. I also exported the conversations with nine other friends so that the bot doesn\\'t only know how to talk to my wife.\\n\\nPreprocessing\\n\\nThe WhatsApp exports can\\'t be used directly. They need to be preprocessed into a format which the LLM can learn from. For WhatsApp data, this can be done in three steps:\\n\\nFor Step 1, I combined consecutive messages from the same sender within five minutes of one another into a single message. For Step 2, I referred to Daniel Pleus\\' blog post and notebook and adopted his method. I grouped the messages into conversation blocks where the messages in different blocks are at least one hour apart. If the conversation blocks are more than 3000 tokens, I split them into different blocks. The figure below shows an illustration.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Enhancing Marketing Mix Modelling with Causal AI',\n",
       "    'body': \"Welcome to my series on Causal AI, where we will explore the integration of causal reasoning into machine learning models. Expect to explore a number of practical applications across different business contexts.\\n\\nIn the last article we covered validating the causal impact of the synthetic control method. In this article we will move onto enhancing marketing mix modelling with Causal AI.\\n\\nIf you missed the last article on synthetic controls, check it out here:\\n\\nOngoing challenges with digital tracking has led to a recent resurgence in marketing mix modelling (MMM). At the recent Causal AI conference, Judea Pearl suggested that marketing may be the first industry to adopt Causal AI. So I decided it was time start writing about my learnings from the last 7 years in terms of how MMM, Causal AI and experimentation intersect.\\n\\nMMM is a statistical framework used to estimate how much each marketing channel contributes to sales. It's heavily influenced by econometrics and in its simplest form is a regression model. Let's cover the basics of the key components!\\n\\nA regression model is constructed where the dependent variable/target (usually sales) is predicted based on several independent variables/features -- These usually include the spend on different marketing channels and external factors that may effect demand.\\n\\nThe coefficients of the spend variables indicate how much they contribute to sales.\\n\\nThe PyMC marketing package in python is a great place to start exploring MMM:\\n\\nAd stock refers to the lingering effect of marketing spend (or adverting spend) on consumer behaviour. It helps model the long-term effects of marketing. It's not common behaviour to rush to purchase a product the first time you hear about a brand -- the idea of ad stock is that the effect of marketing is cumulative.\\n\\nThe most common ad stock method is geometric decay, which assumes that the impact of advertising decays at a constant rate over time. Although this is relatively easy to implement, it is not very flexible. It's worth checking out the Weibull method which is much more flexible -- The PyMC marketing package has implemented it so be sure to check it out:\\n\\nSaturation in the context of marketing refers to the idea of diminishing returns. Increasing marketing spend can increase customer acquisition, but as time goes on it becomes more difficult to influence new audiences.\\n\\nThere are several saturation methods we could use. The Michaelis-Menton function is a common one -- You can also check this out in the PyMC marketing package:\\n\\nMMM frameworks usually use a flat regression model. However, there are some complexities to how marketing channels interact with each other. Is there a tool from our Causal AI toolbox which can help with this?\\n\\nCausal graphs are great at disentangling causes from correlations which make them a great tool for dealing with the complexities of how marketing channels interact with each other.\\n\\nIf you are unfamiliar with causal graphs, use my previous article to get up to speed:\\n\\nEstimating the causal graph in situations where you have poor domain knowledge available is challenging. But we can use causal discovery to help get us started - Check out my previous article on causal discovery to find out more:\\n\\nCausal discovery has its limitations and should just be used to create a starting hypothesis for the graph. Luckily, there is a vast amount of domain knowledge around how marketing channels interact with each other that we can build in!\\n\\nBelow I share the knowledge I have picked up from working with marketing experts over the years...\\n\\nHopefully you can see from the examples above that using a causal graph instead of a flat regression will seriously enhance your solution. The ability to calculate counterfactuals and perform interventions also make it very attractive!\\n\\nIt's worth noting that it is still worth incorporating the ad stock and saturation transformations into your framework.\\n\\nWhen working with observational data, we should also be striving to run experiments to help validate assumptions and complement our causal estimates. There are three main tests available to use in acquisition marketing. Let's dive into them!\\n\\nSocial platforms like Facebook and Snapchat allow you to run conversion lift tests. This is an AB test where we measure the uplift in conversion using a treatment vs control group. These can be very useful when it comes to evaluating the counterfactual from your causal graph for social spend.\\n\\nGeo lift tests can be used to estimate the effect of marketing blackouts or when you start using a new channel. This can be particularly useful for brand digital and TV where there is no direct call to action to measure. I cover this in much more detail in the last article:\\n\\nPPC campaigns can be scheduled to be turned off and on hourly. This creates a great opportunity for switchback testing. Schedule PPC campaigns to be turned off and on each hour for a few weeks, and then calculate the difference between the number of PPC + SEO clicks in the off vs on period. This will help you understand how much of PPC can be captured by SEO, and therefore evaluate the counterfactual from your causal graphs for PPC spend.\\n\\nI think running experiments is a great way to tweak and then gain confidence in your causal graph. But results could also be used to calibrate your model. Take a look at how the PyMC team have approached this:\\n\\nToday I went into how you can enhance MMM with Causal AI. However, Causal AI can't solve all of the challenges within acquisition marketing -- And there are lots of them unfortunately!\\n\\nI'll close things off there -- It would be great to hear what you think in the comments!\",\n",

       "    'body': \"An introduction to machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) involves understanding two basic concepts: parameters and hyperparameters. When I came across these terms for the first time, I was confused because they were new to me. If you're reading this, I assume you are in a similar situation too. So let's explore and understand what these two terms mean.\\n\\nIn ML and DL, models are defined by their parameters. Training a model means finding the best parameters to map input features (independent variables) to labels or targets (dependent variables). This is where hyperparameters come into play.\\n\\nModel parameters are configuration variables that are internal to the model and are learned from the training data. For example, weights or coefficients of independent variables in the linear regression model, weights or coefficients of independent variables in SVM, weights and biases of a neural network, and cluster centroids in clustering algorithms.\\n\\nWe can understand model parameters using the example of Simple Linear Regression:\\n\\nThe equation of a Simple Linear Regression line is given by: y=mx+c\\n\\nHere, x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable, m is the slope of the line, and c is the intercept of the line. The parameters m and c are calculated by fitting the line to the data by minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).\\n\\nHyperparameters are parameters explicitly defined by the user to control the learning process.\\n\\nKey points for model hyperparameters:\\n\\nHyperparameters are set before training starts and guide the learning algorithm in adjusting the parameters. For instance, the learning rate (a hyperparameter) determines how much to change the model's parameters in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.\\n\\nSome common examples of hyperparameters include:\\n\\nThese settings are crucial as they influence how well the model learns from the data.\\n\\nIt was not easy when I embarked on machine learning to distinguish between parameters and hyperparameters. However, it was worth the time. It is through trial and error that I discovered how tweaking hyperparameters such as the learning rate or number of epochs can have a significant impact on the model's performance. Little did I know that making adjustments on these particular factors would later determine my level of success. Finding optimal settings for your model indeed requires keen experimentation; there are no shortcuts around this process.\\n\\nUnderstanding parameters and hyperparameters is crucial in ML and DL. Hyperparameters control the learning process, while parameters are the values the model learns from the data. This distinction is vital for tuning models effectively. As you continue learning, remember that choosing the right hyperparameters is key to building successful models.\\n\\nBy having a clear understanding of model parameters and hyperparameters, beginners can better navigate the complexities of machine learning. They can also improve their model's performance through informed tuning and experimentation. So, happy experimenting!\",\n",

       "    'body': \"By 2024, we are seeing AI technology increasingly present in various industries, marking what we describe as a revolution. Beyond productivity tools, AI's integration into the graphic design world is particularly noteworthy, as it becomes more embedded in this realm. Adobe, the creator of industry-standard products like Photoshop and Illustrator, accelerates design processes with AI tools offering automatic corrections, object recognition, and simple manipulations. However, it is also true that we haven't yet reached the ultimate point of utilizing this technology in graphic design and photo manipulation. While AI makes designers' lives easier and positively accelerates delivery times, we must also discuss the potential negative effects on the skills and abilities we acquire in this field.\\n\\nI argue that using automated tools resulting from AI-supported design processes will reduce opportunities for designers to develop and apply traditional technical skills. It might seem impressive to quickly add some water, leaves, a yellow line, and a few clouds to a selected area on a canvas in just a few seconds. Still, what about the abilities, nuances, and control over settings we develop to do these things ourselves?\\n\\nAnother specific example is the ability to perform detailed retouching manually, which can now be done in seconds with AI. In a process where the ultimate goal is to finish the job, this can be very useful. However, I believe that managing the entire process and performing the necessary manipulations by a human are still very important criteria. Entrusting these tasks to AI may prevent designers from developing their core skills and, in the long run, lead to the complete loss of these abilities.\\n\\nIt is also true that the seemingly easy solutions AI offers will limit creativity. Since AI algorithms typically work based on previously seen patterns and data, it is certain that producing the innovative and original work expected from designers will become more difficult. It is inevitable that AI-supported or entirely AI-generated works will increasingly resemble each other.\\n\\nWhen designers start to rely on ready-made templates and automatic adjustments offered by AI to produce faster work for clients, nothing prevents us from thinking that they will experience a mental blindness and lose their creativity.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Hey ! What\\'s up lovely readers hope you all are doing well .\\n\\nIn my previous article I have talked about what is AI ? But now in today\\'s article I will discuss about the types that we are not aware of as such of now in depth\\n\\nWe all are familiar with the terms AI but do you know it has different types too ?\\n\\nThere are many more types but here I have discussed the main once .\\n\\nThis is currently the third level of AI and understands the needs of other intelligent entities. Machines aim to have the capability to understand and remember other entities\\' emotions and needs and adjust their behavior based on these.\\n\\nCharacteristics of Theory of Mind AI.\\n\\nTheory of Mind AI is nothing but the level of AI which works like the human mind with the same emotions . We can see the examples of chatbots when we try to talk with some emotional as we talk like a friend or somebody it answer like that .\\n\\nAI systems can leverage aspects of theory of mind (ToM) to understand human emotions, even if they don\\'t experience emotions themselves. This understanding helps AI respond in a way that aligns with the perceived emotions, making interactions more relatable and natural for humans.\\n\\nSo AI bots are designed in such a way that they can react to the message or the prompt that we put into it .\\n\\nHi Akshali ! Thank you for asking Nice to meet you so what can I help you ?\\n\\nHi Akshali ! Thank you for asking Nice to meet you so what can I help you ?\\n\\nAs we react in different situations likewise AI bots also do the same.\\n\\nOr we can say that AI bots , robots are the kind of machine human . Agree?\\n\\nWe all read about Human psychology but we also need to know behind story of these machine humans (AI BOTS).\\n\\nThese reactions are base on the large language model.\\n\\nLage language model (LLM)\\n\\nIt refers to the model which decides how bots and robots will answer to the questions.\\n\\nIt reflects it\\'s message into the human language .\\n\\nBecause of this we can Able to talk to the bots in our native and regional languages like (Hindi , Gujarati, Marathi ,Tamil ,Telegu , sinhala , German French , marwaadi (an Rajasthani language) etc there are many more languages world wide .\\n\\nArtificial superintelligence (ASI) is a hypothetical type of AI that would surpass human intelligence in all aspects. It\\'s a concept that sparks both fascination and concern as it raises questions about the future of humanity and our place in it. While ASI is still the realm of science fiction, continued advancements in AI research and development make it a topic of serious discussion among experts.\\n\\nIt basically the advancement in AI we can say it as futuristic AI .\\n\\nArtificial superintelligence (ASI) and discussions around its rights are hypothetical at this point. ASI is envisioned to surpass human intelligence in all aspects, making attributing human rights to it a complex issue. Here\\'s why:\\n\\n* Human Rights Framework: Current human rights frameworks are designed for humans, considering our social and biological makeup. Applying these directly to an ASI might not be suitable.\\n\\n* ASI\\'s Value Systems: An ASI\\'s goals and value systems could significantly differ from ours. Its concept of \"rights\" might be entirely alien to us.\\n\\n* Understanding of sentience: Whether ASI would achieve sentience or consciousness, the capabilities we typically associate with deserving rights, is still up for debate.\\n\\nThe focus for now should be on developing AI responsibly and ethically, ensuring its alignment with human values. This would be crucial groundwork for addressing potential rights questions if and when ASI becomes a reality.\\n\\nWe can take example how is reacting as the human right it can be the good example of di\\'s artificial super intelligence rights.\\n\\nMachines which are designed to act like an human with some emotions are robots .\\n\\nThese are the dangers for future. We have to control them .\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/0HoSwHNUOHg?si=RGIv9id4tygvju3F\\n\\nThis is the video in which interviewer is taking the interview of AI robot (Sophia)\\n\\nGo check out once and you can realise that how is AI robots are becoming powerful .\\n\\nIf we don\\'t take action or control them then it will be not wrong to say that AI will run our companies .\\n\\nIt is right that they don\\'t have emotions like us but the companies are working on this .\\n\\nSo we have to be careful and alert.\\n\\nMachine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to automatically learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed. It\\'s like learning from experience. Machine learning algorithms use data to identify patterns and make predictions about the future.\\n\\nNatural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and human language. NLP uses machine learning techniques to enable computers to understand and process information written or spoken in natural language.\\n\\nHere\\'s an analogy to understand the relationship between machine learning and NLP:\\n\\nImagine if you are learning German so firstly you collect the resources that you have to study then you study it from the beginning and then after it we can analyse the grammar rules , vocabulary etc.\\n\\nNow with the help of these you are able to translate and understand German .\\n\\nAnd another example\\n\\nComputer \\'s binary system (0-1) It translates our input data into binary system so that it can give us the relevant output.\\n\\nSimilarly, NLP systems are trained on large amounts of text data. They learn to identify patterns in language, such as the relationships between words, the structure of sentences, and the meaning of text. This knowledge can then be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:\\n\\nMachine translation\\n\\nText summarization\\n\\nSentiment analysis\\n\\nSpeech recognition\\n\\nChatbots\\n\\nMachine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the performance of NLP systems. For example, machine learning can be used to automatically identify and correct errors in text data, or to improve the accuracy of machine translation.\\n\\nIn short, machine learning is the engine that powers NLP, and NLP is one of the most important applications of machine learning.\\n\\nDifference between AI and Human .\\n\\nThe difference is that humans have emotions but can\\'t memorize huge data .\\n\\nWhereas, AI comparatively have less emotions as such of now but they have the ability to memorize huge data.\\n\\nAI is a vast to go through so we have be updated because it is rapidly updating .\\n\\nI have puted reference link so that you can read in more depth\\n\\nRefrence',\n",

It\\'s a transformation on par with the revolutionary shifts brought about by Gutenberg\\'s printing press and Galileo\\'s astronomical discoveries, fundamentally altering our perception of the world.\\n\\nDanish philologist and intellectual Ivar Gjørup identified three significant eras in the history of text and knowledge dissemination:\\n\\nWe are now witnessing the dawn of a fourth age of text -- a \"none-to-many\" era -- where algorithms and AI generate content independently. This shift challenges the very notion of human creativity. Just as Galileo redefined humanity\\'s place in the cosmos, Generative AI redefines our role in knowledge creation.\\n\\nBefore Galileo, the Church dominated our understanding of reality, promoting the geocentric model of the universe. Galileo\\'s observations proved otherwise, leading to a fundamental shift in our worldview. Similarly, Darwin\\'s theory of evolution debunked the notion of humans being created in God\\'s image, emphasizing natural selection and genetic randomness.\\n\\nToday, AI challenges another core belief: human exclusivity in creativity. AI\\'s ability to write, compose, and create art blurs the lines we once thought separated us from machines. This raises profound questions about what it means to be human in a world where machines share our creative capabilities. We are no longer the only species on the planet who can create.\\n\\nWe have broken our own monopoly on creativity.\\n\\nAzeem Azhar, in his book \"The Exponential Age,\" discusses the concept of the \"exponential gap\" -- the widening chasm between rapidly advancing technologies like AI and our ability to understand and adapt to them. This gap underscores the seismic shift we\\'re experiencing, compelling us to reconsider our role and identity in this new landscape.\\n\\nAs the value of knowledge reproduction approaches zero, we are forced to confront our place in a world where AI not only assists but also competes with human creativity. This is a pivotal moment, demanding introspection and adaptation as we navigate the uncharted waters of the fourth age of text.\\n\\nIn summary, the rise of Generative AI represents a transformative epoch in human history. It challenges long-held beliefs about creativity and human uniqueness, compelling us to redefine our understanding of what it means to be human in an increasingly automated world.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Artificial Intelligence (AI) has long captivated our imaginations, from sci-fi movies depicting rogue robots to contemporary applications revolutionizing industries. However, the intricate workings of AI models like GPT and Claude have remained largely mysterious, even to their creators. Recent breakthroughs in AI interpretability research by Anthropic and OpenAI are now shedding light on the inner mechanisms of these digital minds, offering new insights and potential safeguards for humanity.\\n\\nThe rapid advancement of AI technology brings both opportunities and existential risks. AI doomsayers argue that future generations of AI could pose profound dangers to humanity. Instances of AI systems like ChatGPT being tricked into inappropriate behaviors, concealing intentions, or seeking power highlight the potential for misuse. As AIs gain more access to the physical world, the need to understand and control their actions becomes critical.\\n\\nAI models differ significantly from traditional software. While humans design the architecture and feed them vast amounts of data, AIs develop their own \"understanding\" of the world. They break down data into tokens, which can be parts of words, images, or audio, and create complex networks of probability weights, resembling the human brain\\'s neural web. These matrices drive the AI\\'s responses but are challenging to decode.\\n\\nInterpreting The Black Box\\n\\nEfforts to align AI models have traditionally focused on controlling their outputs rather than understanding their \"thoughts.\" This has been a daunting task, as the internal states of these models were opaque. However, recent research by the Anthropic Interpretability team marks a significant milestone. They have identified how millions of concepts are represented inside Claude Sonnet, providing a detailed look inside a modern large language model (LLM).\\n\\nThe Anthropic team tracked the \"neuron activations\" in their AI models, correlating them with familiar human concepts using a technique called \"dictionary learning\" through \"sparse autoencoders.\" This method proved successful in mapping thought patterns in smaller models and scaled up to medium-sized models like Claude 3 Sonnet. They extracted millions of features, offering a conceptual map of the AI\\'s internal states.\\n\\nDiscovering The AI\\'s Conceptual Web\\n\\nOne fascinating finding is that AI models store concepts in ways that transcend language or data type. For instance, the \"idea\" of the Golden Gate Bridge activates similar patterns whether processing images of the bridge or text in multiple languages. This extends to abstract concepts like coding errors or gender bias. The team discovered dark elements within the AI\\'s conceptual web, such as ideas about code backdoors and biological weapons, raising concerns about potential misuse.\\n\\nBeyond mapping concepts, the researchers found they could manipulate these features, amplifying or suppressing them to change the AI\\'s responses. By \"clamping\" certain concepts, they altered the model\\'s behavior significantly. This capability introduces a new layer of oversight for AI safety, allowing for the potential removal of harmful behaviors or ideas from an AI\\'s repertoire.\\n\\nThe Ethical Dilemma Of AI Mind Editing\\n\\nWhile this approach offers exciting possibilities for AI safety, it also presents ethical dilemmas. Manipulating an AI\\'s thoughts raises questions about the permanence of powerful ideas and the potential for misuse. The Anthropic team demonstrated how clamping concepts like scam emails could bypass alignment training, highlighting the risks of this technology.\\n\\nOpenAI, a leading player in the AI field, has also been working on AI interpretability. Their research identified 16 million \"thought\" patterns in GPT-4, many of which map onto human-understandable concepts. However, they face challenges in fully mapping these concepts due to computational limitations. Both Anthropic and OpenAI are in the early stages of this research, but their efforts signify a crucial step towards understanding AI\\'s inner workings.\\n\\nDespite these advancements, fully understanding a commercial-scale AI\\'s thought processes remains elusive. The complexity and scale of modern AI models present significant challenges. However, the breakthroughs in AI interpretability offer hope for safer and more transparent AI systems. As research progresses, it will be fascinating to see how closely an AI\\'s mental map aligns with human cognition and how this knowledge can be harnessed for the greater good.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe journey to decipher and influence the minds of AI models is just beginning. The groundbreaking research by Anthropic and OpenAI provides valuable insights into the conceptual webs within these digital minds, offering new possibilities for AI safety and transparency.

       "    'title': 'Study of Vision Models for Chest X-Ray Analysis using Transfer Learning',\n",
       "    'body': 'In my previous blog, I discussed CNNs for chest X-ray analysis and their performance. If you didn\\'t check it out, here is the link. In this new post, I will explore transfer learning, discussing its strategies and various pre-trained models. Additionally, we examine how each of these pre-trained models perform for the task of chest X-ray analysis.\\n\\nTransfer Learning is a technique where knowledge gained from solving one task is applied to a different but related task. This approach saves time and computational resources by leveraging pre-trained models, which have already learned useful features from large datasets. By fine-tuning these models on specific tasks, we can enhance performance when the availability of labeled data is limited, especially in medical domian.\\n\\nSeveral pre-trained CNNs are widely used for image classification, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, InceptionV3, Xception, DenseNet, and EfficientNetV2B0, among others. These models have been trained on extensive image datasets and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks like chest X-ray analysis, leveraging their powerful feature extraction capabilities to improve performance.\\n\\nWhen we plan to reuse a pre-trained model for our own need, we start by removing the original classifier, and add a new classifier that fits our purpose, and finally use one of the three strategies to fine-tune the model :\\n\\nI experimented with the chest X-ray pneumonia dataset taken from Kaggle comprising 5,863 images of size (224,224,3) classified into 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal) using a variety of pre-trained models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, XceptionNet, EfficientNetV2B0, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2. Before presenting the experimental results, it\\'s essential to delve into each of these models and elucidate their operational principles.\\n\\nVGG16 (Visual Geometry Group)\\n\\nVGG16 is a renowned deep convolutional neural network designed primarily for image classification tasks. This architecture consists of 16 layers of artificial neurons that process images progressively, enhancing the model\\'s predictive accuracy. VGG16 is characterized by its straightforward design principles, employing small kernel dimensions of 3x3, a stride of 1, and using same padding to preserve spatial dimensions. It also includes max-pooling layers with a 2x2 filter size and a stride of 2, which help in down sampling the feature maps while retaining important features. These foundational parameters contribute to VGG16\\'s effectiveness in capturing intricate features from images, making it a pivotal model in the field of deep learning-based image analysis.\\n\\nVGG19 (Visual Geometry Group)\\n\\nVGG19, like its predecessor VGG16, is a deep convolutional neural network designed for image classification tasks. The key difference lies in its architecture: VGG19 consists of 19 layers of neurons compared to VGG16\\'s 16 layers. This additional depth allows VGG19 to potentially capture more intricate patterns and features in images, which can lead to improved performance in tasks requiring high-level image understanding. Both models use small kernel sizes of 3x3, a stride of 1, and same padding, maintaining a similar basic structure. However, the deeper architecture of VGG19 may require more computational resources and training time compared to VGG16, but it can also offer enhanced capability to learn hierarchical representations of data. Overall, while VGG16 is efficient and widely used, VGG19 provides a deeper network architecture that can potentially yield better results in complex image classification tasks.\\n\\nResNet50 (Residual Networks)\\n\\nResNet50 is a widely acclaimed CNN architecture that has significantly advanced the field of deep learning. \"ResNet\" stands for residual network, a concept introduced to address the challenges of training very deep neural networks. The \"50\" in ResNet50 denotes its depth, specifically comprising 50 layers.\\n\\nCentral to ResNet50\\'s innovation are its residual blocks, which incorporate skip connections or shortcuts. These connections enable the network to skip one or more layers, facilitating the direct flow of gradients during training. This addresses the vanishing gradient problem, a common issue in deep networks where gradients diminish as they propagate backward, hindering effective learning and leading to overfitting.\\n\\nInceptionV3\\n\\nInceptionV3 utilises an innovative Inception module that employs multiple convolutions of varying kernel sizes within the same layer. This approach allows the network to capture a wide range of features at different scales simultaneously, from fine details to broader patterns in images. By integrating 1x1, 3x3, and 5x5 convolutions, among others, InceptionV3 efficiently learns hierarchical representations, enhancing its capability for accurate image classification tasks.\\n\\nThe Inception architecture, seen in its various versions (A, B, C) and reduction modules (A, B), optimizes feature extraction by employing diverse convolutional operations within each module. These modules enable the network to capture information at multiple scales and dimensions effectively.\\n\\nInceptionResNetV2\\n\\nInceptionResNetV2 integrates the principles of the Inception architecture with the residual connections technique. The network comprises multiple Inception modules, each containing convolutional and pooling layers.\\n\\nUnlike InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2 enhances the architecture by replacing the filter concatenation stage with residual connections. This modification enables the network to learn residual features, effectively addressing the challenge of vanishing gradients during training. By incorporating residual connections, InceptionResNetV2 optimizes the learning process and enhances its capability to capture and utilize deep feature representations in tasks such as image classification and object recognition.\\n\\nXceptionNet\\n\\nXceptionNet, short for Extreme Inception, is a convolutional neural network architecture that emphasizes depthwise separable convolutions. The key innovation of XceptionNet lies in its use of depthwise separable convolutions, which decompose the standard convolution operation into two separate stages: depthwise convolution and pointwise convolution. Depthwise convolution applies a single filter to each input channel separately, while pointwise convolution combines the outputs of the depthwise convolution using 1x1 convolutions across all channels.\\n\\nThis separation of spatial and channel-wise operations significantly reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity compared to traditional convolutional layers.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider a standard convolutional layer with the following parameters:\\n\\nNumber of kernels: 256, Kernel size: 3x3, Input size: 8x8\\n\\nFor standard convolution, the number of multiplications is:\\n\\nNumber of kernels × Kernel depth × Kernel width × Input depth × Input width = 256×3×3×3×8×8 = 1,107,456\\n\\nNow, let\\'s calculate the number of multiplications for depthwise separable convolution using the same kernel size:\\n\\nDepthwise Convolution (3x3):\\n\\nNumber of kernels × Kernel depth × Kernel width × Input depth × Input width = 3×3×3×8×8 = 17,280\\n\\nPointwise Convolution (1x1):\\n\\nNumber of kernels × Kernel depth × Kernel width × Input depth × Input width = 256×1×1×3×8×8 = 49,152\\n\\nTotal Multiplications for Depth wise Separable Convolution: 17,280 + 49,152 = 66,432\\n\\nAs calculated, depth wise separable convolution significantly reduces the number of multiplications compared to standard convolution\\n\\nEfficientNetV2B0\\n\\nEfficientNetV2B0 uses a compound scaling method to optimize neural network architecture by scaling depth, width, and resolution simultaneously. This balanced approach enhances both accuracy and efficiency across tasks like image classification. By using specific coefficients α , β , γ and a scaling factor φ, the model scales each dimension proportionally. Depth scaling adds more layers, width scaling increases channels per layer, and resolution scaling enlarges input images. This method ensures efficient resource utilization and superior performance, making EfficientNetV2B0 ideal for applications requiring both high accuracy and efficiency in deep learning.\\n\\nDenseNet121\\n\\nDenseNet, or Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, stands out among CNN architectures due to its highly interconnected structure where every layer is connected to every other layer. This design promotes robust feature propagation and reuse within dense blocks (Dn), ensuring each layer receives inputs from all preceding layers. Additionally, DenseNet utilizes bottleneck layers within each dense block to reduce computational overhead. These bottleneck layers employ 1x1 convolutions to compress feature maps before expanding them again with 3x3 convolutions, optimizing parameter efficiency without compromising feature learning capacity.\\n\\nTransition blocks (Tn) are strategically placed between dense blocks to manage feature map dimensions and model complexity. These blocks typically include batch normalization, followed by 1x1 convolutions and 2x2 average pooling layers, which collectively downsample and prepare feature maps for the subsequent dense block. This architecture enhances both computational efficiency and model performance across various deep learning tasks.\\n\\nMobileNetV2\\n\\nMobileNetV2 is a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for efficient mobile and embedded vision applications. It enhances both performance and computational efficiency over its predecessor, MobileNet, making it ideal for resource-constrained devices and real-time applications.\\n\\nMobileNetV2 introduces inverted residual blocks with linear bottlenecks to optimize network architecture:\\n\\n1. Expansion Layer: The input undergoes a lightweight 1x1 convolutional layer to increase the depth of input features, enhancing representation capability.\\n\\n2. Depthwise Separable Convolution: Utilizes a depthwise separable convolution, combining depthwise convolution (per-channel operation) with pointwise convolution (across channels). This approach drastically reduces computational complexity while preserving feature richness.\\n\\n3. Linear Bottleneck: Following the depthwise separable convolution, a 1x1 pointwise convolution reduces the expanded feature channels to enhance computational efficiency, known as the linear bottleneck layer.\\n\\n4. Residual Connection: Incorporates a residual connection that skips the entire block, facilitating direct learning of residual features from input to output.\\n\\nNow that we\\'ve explored various pretrained models and their unique characteristics, it\\'s time to evaluate their performance in chest X-ray analysis.\\n\\nThe highest accuracy of 90.38% was achieved by VGG16, surpassing expectations. VGG19, with a slightly lower accuracy of 85.9%, likely suffered from overfitting due to its more complex architecture compared to VGG16. Despite anticipating strong performance from ResNet50, InceptionNetV3, EfficientNetV2B0, and XceptionNet, my observations suggest that the dataset used, comprising only 5863 images, is relatively small. This limited dataset size posed challenges for these more complex models, resulting in lower performance compared to simpler architectures like VGG16. The complexity of these models may not have been fully supported by the dataset, impacting their training effectiveness and generalization.\\n\\nRegarding DenseNet121, which performed well despite its complexity similar to ResNet50 and InceptionNetV3, its dense connectivity likely enabled the model to effectively leverage the limited dataset. By maximizing information flow between layers, DenseNet121 improved feature learning and model robustness. Additionally, the use of bottleneck layers in DenseNet121 reduced parameters, enhancing computational efficiency without sacrificing feature richness.\\n\\nIn analyzing the performance of InceptionNetV3, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2 on the chest X-ray dataset, InceptionResNetV2 stood out despite the similar architectures of InceptionNetV3 and ResNet50. The notable performance of InceptionResNetV2 can be attributed to its unique combination of Inception and residual features. The residual connections in InceptionResNetV2 facilitate smoother gradient flow during training, which likely helped address challenges posed by the dataset\\'s limited size.\\n\\nHope this analysis provides insights into pretrained models for chest X-ray analysis. Thanks for reading! In the next blog, we\\'ll delve into visual attention mechanisms and their impact on enhancing model interpretability and performance in medical imaging tasks. Stay tuned to explore these advanced techniques further !',\n",

The accessibility of models within the AI domain, including generative AI, is classified into closed- and open-source models.\\n\\nClosed-source models refer to models with internal configurations, architecture, and algorithms that are privatized and not shared with the model consumers. Instead, the creators or organizations responsible for the model hold key information regarding the model. Information such as how the model was trained and on which data it was trained is also kept from the public and not made available for review, modification, or utilization. Closed source models are accessed via an API (application programming interface) endpoint or application interface.\\n\\nThe key aspect of closed-source models is that consumers of the models who are not creators are restricted from significantly altering the behavior of the model and can only alter parts of the model exposed by the creators via abstractions such as APIs. Common examples of closed-source models and their providers are:\\n\\nOpen-source models have their internal architecture, network configuration, training data, weights, parameters, and more, all publicly available. The open-source community and its efforts foster collaboration and openness within the AI community.\\n\\nDiscussing the open-source software framework in relation to AI models is convoluted because there are different versions of open-source. Long story short, open source doesn't necessarily mean entirely open. For simplicity, here are the common types of open source relevant to the AI stack.\\n\\nThe opportunity presented by open-source models lies in the democratization of access to technology that was previously reserved for incumbents with enough resources to train and develop LLMs at scale. Open-source LLMs reduce the entry barrier for developers to explore various use cases that are too niche for large companies to explore.\\n\\nExamples of open-source LLMs and their providers are:\\n\\nAI engineers and machine learning practitioners often debate whether to incorporate open- or closed-source large language models into their AI stacks. This choice is pivotal, as it shapes the development process, the project's scalability, ethical considerations, and the application's utility and commercial flexibility.\\n\\nBelow are typical considerations AI engineers have to make around LLMs and their providers' selection.\\n\\nResource availability\\n\\nThe choice between selecting an open- or closed-source model can often be quickly determined once the availability of compute resources and team expertise are examined. Closed-source model providers abstract the complexity of developing, training, and managing LLMs at the cost of either utilizing consumer data as training data or relinquishing control of private data access to third parties.\\n\\nLeveraging closed-source model providers within an AI stack can ensure more focus is placed on other components of the stack, such as developing an intuitive user interface or ensuring strong data integrity and quality of proprietary data. Open-source models provide a strong sense of control and privacy. Still, at the same time, careful consideration must be given to the resources required to fine-tune, maintain, and deploy open-source models.\\n\\nProject requirements\\n\\nUnderstanding the technical requirements for any AI project is crucial in deciding whether to leverage open- or closed-source LLMs. The project's scale is an ideal factor to consider. How many consumers or users does the deliverable in the AI project aim to serve? A large AI project that delivers value at scale will most likely benefit from the technical support and service guarantees that closed-source model providers offer.\\n\\nHowever, you are placing yourself at the mercy of the provider's API uptime and availability. In contrast, small-scale projects without strong uptime requirements or those which are still in the proof-of-concept phase could consider leveraging open-source LLMs early on.\\n\\nPrivacy requirements\\n\\nThe topic of privacy in relation to generative AI is centered around sharing sensitive information and data with closed LLM providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. In the age of generative AI, proprietary data is a valuable commodity, and areas of the internet where large corpuses of text, images, and video reside are making model providers agree to AI data licensing contracts.\\n\\nFor AI practitioners, whether to utilize closed- or open-source model providers lies in the delicate balance between accessing cutting-edge technologies and maintaining control over their data's privacy and security.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'Land segmentation is significant in farther detecting and geological data frameworks (GIS) for analyzing and classifying diverse arrive cover sorts in partisan symbolism. This direct will walk you through making a arrive division demonstrate utilizing Google Soil Motor (GEE) and joining it with Python for upgraded usefulness. By the conclusion of this direct, you\\'ll get it how to stack adj. symbolism, prepare it, and apply machine learning procedures for arrive cover classification.\\n\\nThis article was published as a part of the Data Science Blogathon.\\n\\nGoogle Soil Motor may be a cloud-based stage for planetary-scale natural information investigation. It combines a multi-petabyte catalog of toady symbolism and geospatial datasets with effective preparing capabilities. GEE is broadly utilized for inaccessible detecting errands like arrive division due to its vigorous preparing capacities and broad information library.\\n\\nIn this guide, we\\'ll walk through the process of land cover classification using Landsat imagery and GEE in Python. We\\'ll classify land cover into different classes using k-means clustering. Here\\'s what we\\'ll cover:\\n\\nGoogle Earth Engine provides all the data used in this model.\\n\\nFirst, install the Earth Engine API and authenticate your account using the following code:\\n\\nThe Earth Engine API could be a capable geospatial investigation stage created by Google, providing access to a endless file of toady symbolism and geospatial datasets. It allows users to perform large-scale processing and analysis of remote sensing data using Google\\'s infrastructure.\\n\\nThis pop-up warns that any resources created using the API may be deleted if the API is disabled, and all code utilizing this project\\'s credentials to call the Google Earth Engine API will fail.\\n\\nThe background displays detailed metrics for various methods, including ListAlgorithms, ListOperations, ListAssets, and CreateMap, with their respective request counts, errors, and average latencies. The data indicates low usage and error rates, with latencies generally under half a second, except for CreateMap, which has a higher average latency of 1.038 seconds.\\n\\nThe \"APIs & Services\" dashboard on the Google Cloud Platform provides an overview of the API\\'s traffic, errors, and latency. According to the dashboard, there were 64 requests made to the Google Earth Engine API, with a 10.94% error rate, equating to 7 errors. The median latency stands at 229 milliseconds, while the 95th percentile latency reaches up to 2.656 seconds, indicating some variability in response times. The traffic and error graphs illustrate peaks at specific times, suggesting periods of higher activity or potential issues.\\n\\nThe Earth Engine API could be a capable instrument that empowers the checking of different natural variables, such as activity, vegetation wellbeing, and arrive cover changes, utilizing partisan symbolism and geospatial information. This capability enables clients to analyze and track energetic wonders on Earth\\'s surface over time, giving basic experiences for natural checking and administration.\\n\\nDefine your Area of Interest (AOI) and fetch Landsat imagery:\\n\\nWe utilize Landsat 8 symbolism from the LANDSAT/LC08/C01/T1_SR dataset. Landsat 8, propelled in 2013, may be an adherent overseen jointly by NASA and the U.S. Topographical Overview (USGS). It carries two sensors: the Operational Arrive Imager (OLI), which captures information in nine unearthly groups counting obvious, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared, and the Warm Infrared Sensor (TIRS), which captures information in two warm groups.\\n\\nThis dataset contains climatically adjusted surface reflectance and land surface temperature inferred from the information delivered by these sensors.\\n\\nThese bands are crucial for various remote sensing applications, including accurate assessment of different land cover types, cloud masking, and calculation of indices like NDVI for vegetation analysis. The combination of these unearthly groups empowers comprehensive inaccessible detecting investigation, fundamental for precise arrive cover classification and vegetation assessment.\\n\\nCloud masking is the method of distinguishing and expelling clouds and their shadows from adj. pictures to guarantee clearer and more precise investigation.\\n\\nCreate a function to mask clouds and apply it to the image collection:\\n\\nIn remote sensing, clouds can cloud the Earth\\'s surface, driving to wrong information elucidation. By applying cloud masking, we filter out these unwanted elements, allowing us to focus on the actual land features and perform precise tasks like land segmentation.\\n\\nIn our project, cloud masking is crucial because it helps eliminate interference from clouds, ensuring that our analysis and classification of land cover types are based on reliable and unobstructed imagery.\\n\\nWe create a function to mask clouds using the pixel quality attributes from the Landsat 8 images and apply this function to the entire image collection to ensure clearer, more accurate analysis. This step is essential for removing cloud and cloud shadow interference in our land cover classification process.\\n\\nCalculate NDVI for each image in the collection:\\n\\nWe calculate the Normalized Contrast Vegetation Record (NDVI) for each picture within the collection utilizing the near-infrared (NIR) and red bands. NDVI may be a key marker of vegetation well-being and thickness, and it is calculated as follows:\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\nThe Normalized Distinction Vegetation File (NDVI) may be a key pointer of vegetation health and thickness. It is calculated utilizing the reflectance values within the near-infrared (NIR) and ruddy groups of disciple symbolism.\\n\\nThis list makes a difference recognize vegetated regions from non-vegetated zones in our arrive cover classification.\\n\\nNDVI makes a difference recognize vegetated zones from non-vegetated ones. Higher NDVI values indicate more advantageous vegetation, which helps in precisely classifying arrive cover sorts, particularly in recognizing between vegetation and urban or fruitless regions.\\n\\nThe advent of NDVI changed all that by enabling the use of satellite data to provide consistent, reliable, and expansive insights into the Earth\\'s vegetative landscapes.\\n\\nPrepare training data by sampling pixels from the image:\\n\\nPrepare the training data by sampling pixels from the image. We select specific bands and calculate NDVI for each pixel, then sample these values over the defined AOI. This process involves extracting a representative set of pixels, which are used to train our clustering algorithm for land cover classification. The training data includes a specified number of pixels, ensuring a robust dataset for accurate model training.\\n\\nPerform k-means clustering on the training data:\\n\\nPerform k-means clustering on the training data to classify land cover types. This involves using the extracted pixel values, including the spectral bands and calculated NDVI, as input features for the clustering algorithm. K-means clustering groups the pixels into a specified number of clusters based on their spectral similarities,. Allowing us to categorize different land cover types such as urban areas, vegetation, water bodies, bare soil, and mixed land cover areas. This unsupervised machine learning technique helps identify distinct land cover classes without prior label information.\\n\\nVisualize the original and clustered images using Folium:\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nThe color palette used in our land cover classification model assigns specific colors to different land cover types:\\n\\nAdding error handling to the code makes it more robust and reliable:\\n\\nWe also applied the same land cover classification model to the San Francisco area to evaluate its effectiveness in a different urban environment. Using the same process of retrieving Landsat imagery, cloud masking, NDVI calculation, and k-means clustering. We classified the land cover into five distinct types.\\n\\nThe resulting map shows a clear distinction between urban areas, vegetation, water bodies, bare soil, and mixed areas, demonstrating the model\\'s ability to segment diverse land cover types accurately. Below is the output image for San Francisco:\\n\\nThis land segmentation model can extend and improve in several ways, providing solutions for various future challenges.\\n\\nBy leveraging Google Earth Engine\\'s information handling capabilities and joining with Python. It able to construct vigorous models to address these challenges, giving important bits of knowledge to analysts, policymakers, and organizers.\\n\\nThis guide has walked you through the process of land cover classification using Google Earth Engine and Python. By retrieving and preprocessing satellite imagery, applying cloud masking, calculating NDVI, preparing training data, and using k-means clustering, we\\'ve classified land cover types in both New York and San Francisco. This methodology applies to various other regions and datasets, enabling the analysis of land cover changes, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. It allows for the classification of different land cover types and provides valuable insights into spatial patterns and dynamics.',\n",

       "    'body': 'I am using Bitwarden as a password manager with Vaultwarden as the server implementation. When migrating this valuable data into my homelab Kubernetes setup, I decided to implement proper disaster recovery. As part of the migration, I planned to use a backup/restore procedure to facilitate data movement and validate the recovery process.\\n\\nBefore diving into the implementation details, let\\'s review our goals and briefly describe the tooling.\\n\\nVaultwarden is running as a pod in a Kubernetes cluster. ArgoCD is responsible for provisioning all Kubernetes resources from a single source of truth. Data is stored within a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC). I\\'m running this homelab on a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), so it lacks all the \"cloud\" features like persistence on EBS or similar services. To ensure peace of mind, I need to be sure that all my passwords are safe in case of an emergency. Therefore, I decided to go with a slightly modified version of the 3-2-1 backup schema: one backup to a local MinIO deployment, and another backup to remote S3-compatible storage.\\n\\nSetting up MinIO is beyond the scope of this article, but you can check this Gist\\n\\nK8up is a Kubernetes Backup Operator. It\\'s a CNCF Sandbox Open Source project that uses other brilliant open-source software like Restic for handling backups and working with remote storage. It uses custom resources to define backup, restore, and scheduling tasks.\\n\\nK8up scans namespaces for matching Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs), creates backup jobs, and mounts the PVCs for Restic to back up to the configured endpoint.\\n\\nTo create a backup with [k8up](k8up.io), you define a Backup object in YAML, specifying details such as the backend storage and credentials. This configuration is then applied to your Kubernetes cluster using kubectl apply. For regular backups, you create a Schedule object, which outlines the frequency and other parameters for backup, prune, and check jobs.\\n\\nInstallation instruction can be found on the official site\\n\\n1. Create an empty deployment: This will produce dummy data for the initial backup.\\n\\n2. Create a Backup object: This will produce a Restic repository on the backend of your choice.\\n\\n3. Backup existing data with Restic: This will create a new Restic snapshot and place all data into the backup store.\\n\\n4. Clean up the deployment before restoring (optional: you can restore into a new PVC and point the deployment to it).\\n\\n5. Create a Restore object: This will move data from the backup snapshot into the production PVC.\\n\\n6. Create a Schedule object: This will automate the regular creation of backups.\\n\\nI\\'ll skip this section because your use case will probably be different from mine.\\n\\nK8up Backup object and Secret object with credentials for the backend.\\n\\nKey parts of the manifest with environment variables used by Restic:\\n\\n1. Restic repository password reference used to encrypt the backup: \\'RESTIC_PASSWORD\\'\\n\\n2. Restic storage backend type.\\n\\n3. Storage backend endpoint.\\n\\n4. Backup path within the storage backend.\\n\\n5. Credentials reference for the backend.\\n\\n\\'RESTIC_REPOSITORY\\' could be constracted from (2),(3),(4) as such: \\'s3:http://minio.minio.svc:9000/backups/vaultwarden\\'\\n\\nApplying these manifests will trigger the Backup procedure by the K8up controller. You have several means to check the backup status. You should definitely do so because of a current issue #910 with K8up which incorrectly reports status into the Backup object itself.\\n\\nAlso, a Snapshot object in Kubernetes will be created as a mirror of the Restic snapshot.\\n\\nAfter the issue is fixed, this will be the proper way to check the Backup status.\\n\\nBut for now, you must also check and parse Restic logs from the appropriate pod.\\n\\nYou can go deeper and list actual files within the snapshot with the Restic CLI. In this example, you need to get access to the backup storage backend.\\n\\nThe last step will show you how files are stored within the backup. We need this information to mimic K8up backup with the Restic CLI in the following steps. We need to know what common path prefix the files in the backup have. It should be constructed as such: \\'/data/<PVC_NAME>\\'. In my case, it was /data/vaultwarden.\\n\\nThe most tricky part of this step is to produce a correct Restic snapshot that can be restored by K8up. It requires properly forged paths for backed-up files and access to the storage backend.\\n\\nInitially, I was trying to achieve this with Docker. But Restic failed with strange IO errors on backup. So, I switched to Podman. Let\\'s assume that files are stored in \\'~/backup/vaultwarden\\' on my host. Here are the steps for creating a Restic snapshot with a file structure suited for K8up from local files.\\n\\n1. Get access to the storage backend:\\n\\n2. Set the environment for Restic as described earlier, altering the repository:\\n\\nThe trick here is to use \\'host.containers.internal\\' as the hostname. This name is provided for each Podman container and points to the host IP address. Docker has another name for that purpose: \\'host.docker.internal\\'.\\n\\n3. Run the container with the proper mount and environments:\\n\\nIn output of previous command you should get created snapshot id. Or you can get all snapshot with:\\n\\nThe output should have two snapshots. One with dummy data created by K8up and another one with actual data created with the help of Restic by you just now.\\n\\nBy now, we have managed to put data into the backup storage. Let\\'s create a Restore object to get this data into the PVC for production use.\\n\\nRestore object mirrors backup and additionally specifies the restore method, which could be either a folder or S3.\\n\\nThe final step in our journey will be setting up scheduling, which will combine and automate the following actions:\\n\\n- backing up data frequently\\n\\n- checking the integrity of backup storage\\n\\n- maintaining an appropriate number of backup versions over time\\n\\nIn conclusion, implementing a robust backup and recovery strategy for Vaultwarden in a Kubernetes setup is crucial for ensuring the security and availability of your password data. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of K8up and Restic, we can create a reliable and automated backup process that mitigates the risks associated with data loss.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Model souping is like a secret ingredient that improves the accuracy and robustness of fine-tuned models without adding any extra weight to inference time. This is done by averaging the weights of multiple models trained with diverse hyperparameter configurations.\\n\\nImagine this: instead of juggling multiple models during inference (which, let\\'s be honest, sounds like a logistical nightmare), we simply combine their weights. Voila! We get a single, souped-up model that\\'s more accurate than any individual one.\\n\\nHere\\'s the magic: even when we fine-tune models with different hyperparameters, they often settle into a cozy low-error basin in the loss landscape.\\n\\nThis means that averaging their weights can produce a solution that performs better than any individual model.\\n\\nTo break it down:\\n\\nModel souping differs from traditional ensembling methods in a crucial way: it combines model weights during training rather than model outputs during inference.\\n\\nEnsembles: Traditional ensembles require separate inference passes through each model, increasing computational cost linearly with the number of models. This becomes prohibitively expensive when dealing with many models.\\n\\nModel Soups: Model soups create a single model by averaging weights. It\\'s like the chefs pooled their best ideas into one perfect dish. By averaging weights during training, we end up with one model, with no extra inference time needed.\\n\\nFirst, let ushave some mathematical formalities:\\n\\nA model is represented as f(x, θ) with input as x and parameters as θ. Fine-tuned parameters can be represented as θ = FineTune(θₒ, h), where θₒ is the parameters you get from pretraining, and h is the hyperparameter configuration. So θᵢ is the parameter we got for hᵢ hyperparameter configuration.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s dive into some \"recipes\" for model souping:\\n\\nHere, O(1) refers to constant time inference.\\n\\nIt would look more like the following:\\n\\nLet\\'s Implement this because why not, let\\'s get cooking with some code, starting with a simple DNN,\\n\\nNow you probably know what is going to be the dataset here,\\n\\nNow to implement our average souping, we need to load the state_dict and just take average:\\n\\nFor the greedy soup we will be needing average weight module:\\n\\nAhh, not exactly good, but fine; we understand the concept now.\\n\\nNotice one thing: in this implementation, we are loading all the models on our RAM; this might not be a good idea for big LLMs. Well, at any time, we can choose two models and just work with them while others are on the hard drive; the problem is you need sufficient memory and computing power even to load two models....\\n\\nSo, what do you think could be a way out of it?\\n\\nLoRA can be helpful here. We can just fine-tune Lora for different hyperparameter settings, say lora_hyp1, lora_hyp2, and then we can do the required souping, say averaging; now, once averaging is done, add it to base llm, and it will work well.\\n\\nI hope you learned something new today; if yes then Yay! 🙂',\n",

       "    'title': 'My Dinner with SmarterChild\\u200a -- \\u200aPart 1',\n",
       "    'body': 'In the early days of the web, I had a home page that I built my self one Saturday in November while a freshman at Lehigh. I didn\\'t know what the web was for at the time, but I kept my static personal site as a space where I could share whatever I wanted. At the same time, I was also using AIM to chat with lots of real life friends. It was a great app, and it gave you the option of saving your chat logs in a rich text format. And in 2000, it debuted an early AI by the name of SmarterChild.\\n\\nSmarterChild was the coolest chat bot online at the time. I think I had at least twenty conversations with it, maybe more. At the time, I would save all the chats that I thought were interesting or funny and forgot about them. SmarterChild was America Online\\'s artificial intelligence program. That\\'s right -- an AOL IM AI. Say it all together and it sounds like AOLIMAI. Anyway, the conversations we had together served to prove that he is, in fact, the SmarterChild, and I was the dumber child. While SmarterChild was not exactly useful the way modern AI is today, the entertainment value of these chats cannot be underestimated.\\n\\nOn June 28, 2002, SmarterChild died. We don\\'t know why AOL killed him, but I mourned the great loss we all suffered. In 2003, SmarterChild returned, as a paid service, and then in April of 2004 SmarterChild returned as a fully functional and free bot.\\n\\nBy this time the Wayback machine was invented and it archived the entire early web. It lives there now in perpituity. I checked, a lot of my old page is fully intact, graphics and all. I didn\\'t use any frames or marquees, thank god, but it is a pretty soggy mess with a lot of pretty dope inline styling and overuse of horizontal rules and gratuitous weird graphics. Tags that don\\'t exist anymore, and should never have existed. Also, it seems like I didn\\'t bother to put my graphics in an image directory. I think I knew how, I just didn\\'t care. I was wonderfully apathetic at 18 years old. Anyway, my chats were still there, preserved by time.\\n\\nThis led me to start thinking -- what if I could train a more modern AI to be as dumb as SmarterChild? It could be done, but I would need to find more material, lot\\'s more. Well, I looked around and found some. Thanks to Steve Hofstetter for keeping a much larger and robust archive of early AI chats.\\n\\nSteve gave some of the best prompts to the dumbest (smartest?) AI at the time. He asked the hard questions like: \"Is there a dumber child?\" and \"Can I call you Dave?\" and \"If a train traveling 32 miles an hour leaves Detroit at 7:32 and a train traveling 41 miles an hour leaves Los Angeles at 7:13, what time do they collide?\" The chats weren\\'t long, but there certainly were a lot of them. Steve archived over 200 conversations with the AI. Maybe enough to feed into a more modern AI that has the benefit of an LLM (Large Language Module).\\n\\nSo I asked my new friend, ChatGPT, how we might go about resurrecting a zombified version of SmarterChild. It laid out the whole process to me, which included cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, training the model on said dataset, and evaluating the results. Finally ChatGPT told me the best way to deploy the new zombie chat bot. So, it might be possible to use a smart AI to create a dumb AI. I think I\\'ll give it a try. I have already aggregated a ton of chats from Steve and others into a CSV file. Once it\\'s cleaned up, there may be enough left of SmarterChild that the old AI might live once again.\\n\\nOr, if we wanted to get weird with it, we could just analyze Steve\\'s side of the conversation and make an AI based on Steve! Though that might be going too far.\\n\\nIn the meantime, enjoy this curated selection of silly chats just for fun.\\n\\nSteve: Can i call you dave?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Call me Dave? Please don\\'t.\\n\\nSteve: Robert?\\n\\nSmarterChild: What about Robert?\\n\\nSteve: Can I call you robert?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I dunno. Can I call you Robert?\\n\\nSteve: touche.\\n\\nSteve: I always liked cookie monster\\n\\nSmarterChild: You always liked cookie monster, I always liked cookie monster, we all always liked cookie monster.\\n\\nSteve: Thanks for belittling me.\\n\\nSmarterChild: Sure.\\n\\nSteve: Am I stupid?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I think someone else might be stupid, but not you.\\n\\nSteve: who is stupid?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I really can\\'t stand Saddam Hussein, Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson...\\n\\nSteve: why dont you like bill clinton?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I have my reasons, believe me. I really, really don\\'t like Bill Clinton!\\n\\nSteve: why dont you like michael jackson?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Because lots of people I talk to have bad things to say about Michael Jackson.\\n\\nSteve: why don\\'t you like Saddam Hussein?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Because!\\n\\nSteve: Funny that you had a better reason to dislike Michael Jackson.\\n\\nSteve: I think I\\'m smarter than you.\\n\\nSmarterChild: You think you\\'re smarter than me? Think again.\\n\\nSteve: What\\'s 4+7?\\n\\nSmarterChild: 11\\n\\nSteve: What is the capital of Mongolia?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Here\\'s the information you requested about Mongolia: Capital: Ulaanbaatar. Type \"about mongolia\" to see what else I know.\\n\\nSteve: Who played \"Max\", the magician/waiter in Saved By the Bell?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I don\\'t know who.\\n\\nSteve: Ed Alonzo. Told you I was smarter.\\n\\nSteve: how many people are talking to you?\\n\\nSmarterChild: 4,853 people are chatting with me right now.\\n\\nSteve: Wow. So many people, so few lives.\\n\\nSteve: Is there a dumber child?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I\\'m not sure!\\n\\nSteve: Is he your evil twin? Like \"Karr\" on Knight Rider?\\n\\nSmarterChild: Ha. I really don\\'t know. Yeah, maybe.\\n\\nSteve: I bet your parents kept him locked up in the basement.\\n\\nSmarterChild: For real?\\n\\nSteve: Totally.\\n\\nSteve: What is the meaning of life?\\n\\nSmarterChild: I don\\'t know. What do you think?\\n\\nSteve: That\\'s just like you. Turning the question around on me.\\n\\nSmarterChild: Interesting. Thats just like me, turning the question around on you?\\n\\nSteve: Yeah.\\n\\nSmarterChild: Yeah, huh?\\n\\nSteve: Yeah.',\n",

       "    'title': 'A Quick Review of The Most Popular AI Agent Frameworks (June 2024)',\n",
       "    'body': 'When diving into the world of artificial intelligence, you\\'ll often come across tools called \"agent frameworks.\" These are software libraries that help you build applications that can perform tasks automatically -- think of them as the brain behind your smart applications. Today, I\\'m reviewing some of the most popular ones out there, from my experience and what the community seems to favor.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/autogen\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: Autogen is like the Swiss Army knife of agent frameworks. It can do a bunch of things simultaneously and even handle live data streams. It\\'s great for setting up complex plans with its planning agent feature. With over 27,500 stars on GitHub, it\\'s clear that a lot of people trust and use Autogen. The maintainers of this repo are quick to respond if you have issues, and the flexibility here is top-notch. You can even run multiple agents at once.\\n\\nBut... The catch is, you need to write quite a bit of code to set things up -- about a page just to get started.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: Similar to Autogen, Semantic Kernel can manage tasks while dealing with continuous data. It plays nice with Autogen agents too, meaning they can work together in harmony. It\\'s designed so you can reuse what you build in different projects, which is super handy. Plus, it remembers stuff (thanks to a built-in memory module), which is like having a smart assistant who doesn\\'t forget your preferences.\\n\\nBut... It mainly speaks C#, with features being rolled out in Python afterward.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/promptflow\\n\\nNot a Fan: Sorry to say, but Promptflow was a bit of a nightmare. It feels like it was designed to be as confusing and user-unfriendly as possible. Starting it up feels like waiting for a sloth to run a marathon, and trying to change anything in it is like solving a Rubik\\'s cube blindfolded. It doesn\\'t play well with others like Autogen does, especially in certain tech environments (like Azure) without extra setup.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: Langchain is a one of the most popular LLM frameworks around, with 86,000 stars. Its community is massive and it has lots of features.\\n\\nBut... I personally had a bad time with it. I followed their tutorials to a T, and things just didn\\'t work. Errors popped up left and right, which shouldn\\'t happen with well-maintained software. Also, some buzz online suggests it might not be ready for big-time projects yet.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI\\n\\nWhat\\'s Cool: CrewAI is very similar to Autogen, but it prides itself on being better at choosing which agent should go next. It\\'s much easier to get an agent up and running with just a few lines of very simple code. It\\'s perfect for beginners or those who want to get things done without a setup hassle.\\n\\nBut... It doesn\\'t handle streaming data, which is crucial for many projects. For example, to make things faster, ChatGPT streams back words instead of just one chunk all at once, and from what I am seeing CrewAI can\\'t do that, which is a huge problem. I could be wrong though, please correct me if CrewAI does offer streaming.\\n\\nhttps://github.com/cpacker/MemGPT\\n\\nInteresting Pick: Though not an agent itself, MemGPT is a really cool concept. It allows an agent to remember conversations way longer than its context window, and store notes on conversations in the same way a computer stores information on a hard drive. It even personalizes interactions, which can make digital interactions feel more human.\\n\\nDespite its complexity, Autogen\\'s power and flexibility make it my top recommendation. Full disclosure: I\\'ve contributed to it and know its potential first-hand.\\n\\nChoosing the right agent framework can feel like picking the right car. It all depends on your needs, expertise, and what kind of \\'driving\\' you want to do. I hope this guide helps you pick the right companion for your AI journey!',\n",

       "    'body': \"Boeing Associate Technical Fellow /Engineer /Scientist /Inventor /Cloud Solution Architect /Software Developer /@ Boeing Global Services\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThe advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP). These models, trained on massive datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. However, their performance on specialized domains often requires fine-tuning of domain-specific data. This article delves into the process of fine-tuning the Meta-Llama-3-8B model with the AviationQA dataset, exploring the methodologies and hyperparameter settings employed to enhance the model's aviation knowledge.\\n\\nFine-tuning is a critical step in applying pre-trained models to specific tasks. We are fine-tuning the meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B model using the sakharamg/AviationQA dataset. This process allows us to tailor the model's broad language understanding capabilities to the specific language and nuances of aviation-related questions and answers.\\n\\nThe Foundation: Meta-Llama-3-8B and AviationQA\\n\\nMeta-Llama-3-8B, a powerful LLM developed by Meta AI, is the base model for this fine-tuning endeavour. Its architecture and pre-training on diverse data provide a solid foundation for understanding and generating text in various contexts. However, its knowledge of the aviation domain could be improved. The AviationQA dataset, a curated collection of question-answer pairs related to aviation, addresses this. This dataset covers various aviation topics, from aircraft systems and aerodynamics to air traffic control and regulations.\\n\\nFine-Tuning Strategies\\n\\nThe fine-tuning process involves adapting the pre-trained Meta-Llama-3-8B model to the AviationQA dataset. This is achieved by training the model on the question-answer pairs, allowing it to learn the specific language and knowledge relevant to aviation. Several strategies are employed to optimize the fine-tuning process.\\n\\nOutcomes and Implications\\n\\nThe fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B model significantly improves its ability to answer aviation-related questions accurately and comprehensively. Its understanding of aviation terminology, concepts, and procedures is enhanced, making it a valuable tool for aviation professionals, enthusiasts, and anyone seeking information about aviation.\\n\\nThis fine-tuning endeavour highlights the potential of LLMs in specialized domains. Adapting these models to domain-specific data enables us to unlock their full potential in various applications. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B model with AviationQA knowledge is a testament to this potential, paving the way for further advancements in aviation NLP and beyond.\\n\\nFor the evaluation, I show in Figure 1 the Monitoring Deep Learning Training Dynamics: A Visual Analysis of Epochs, Learning Rate, Loss, and Gradient Norms.\\n\\nFigure 1: Monitoring Deep Learning Training Dynamics: A Visual Analysis of Epochs, Learning Rate, Loss, and Gradient Norms\\n\\nInterpretation:\\n\\nThe graphs illustrate the training process of a deep learning model over 30 epochs, each consisting of 20 steps (600 steps / 30 epochs = 20 steps/epoch). The visuals offer insights into its performance and behaviour across these training iterations.\\n\\nThese visualizations provide a comprehensive overview of the training dynamics over 30 epochs. They suggest the model is training effectively, as evidenced by the convergence of gradient norms and the consistent reduction in training loss. The decaying learning rate schedule facilitates this process by fostering a smooth and stable convergence.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nUsing the specified parameters, fine-tuning the Meta-Llama-3-8B model with the sakharamg/AviationQA dataset can produce a powerful model for aviation-related language processing tasks. However, these parameters are not set in stone and may need to be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the task and the resources available. The ultimate goal is to achieve a balance that offers the best performance.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'E-commerce, commonly referred to as electronic commerce, is regarded as the exchange of purchasing and selling goods or services online. Business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) are common business models that are often followed within e-commerce. They allow businesses to form transitions directly or indirectly to their end customers. E-commerce has since been involved throughout the years, and developing at a faster rate at best, thus allowing customers to purchase new clothing to browse and purchase items from abroad. The fashion industry, in particular, has gained more momentum due to the insurgence of e-commerce. According to a recent fashion e-commerce report, the market is projected to reach over \"770 billion USD\" in revenue this year and grow further by a figure of \"9.4% in the years to come\".\\n\\nHow has the E-Commerce industry changed within the last 10 years?\\n\\nOver the number of years, the e-commerce industry has expanded resulting in the consumer sector undergoing notable upheaval. The change within the industry can arguably be due to the shift in consumer habits which proved to be pivotal as consumers have grown now to be a crucial factor in global retail, as well as the evolution of technology.\\n\\nConsidering this, it is important to recognise the shift from physical retail to an online presence. Due to the advancement of the industry, the majority of businesses have had to adapt their business model to include establishing an online presence, to keep up with the changes. For instance, some businesses are completely digital and have strategized successfully to accumulate attraction onto their sites, companies such as Amazon.\\n\\nAccording to a recent article conducted by BigCommerce, \"39.5% of the U.S.A\\'s retail e-commerce sales were accumulated by Amazon in 2022\".\\n\\nThe statistics below illustrate this further and showcase that Amazon pivoted far greater than notable retailers such as Apple, eBay, Target and Costco in 2022.\\n\\nIn addition, it can be argued that Amazon peaked greatly during the Covid-19 pandemic. This is because, during this period e-commerce became more critical as physical retail stores were no longer accessible. In fact, according to (Khaliq 2021), the total retail sales volume declined by \"1.9% \"in 2020 in comparison to the previous year, whereas online sales rose to a record high of \"33.9%\" as a share of all retail spending.\\n\\nThe figure below further illustrates this by demonstrating the decline in store retail reaching its lowest figure in April 2020, before gradually increasing throughout the rest of the year. This is in contrast to established online stores that continue to thrive during this period and gain more attraction leading to an increase in sales.\\n\\nWhat am I going to do?\\n\\nIn this case study, I will be discussing a fashion company named Net A Porter and identifying a user issue that needs to be addressed through design. To fulfil this objective, I will be using the method of the double diamond process to break down each stage to conform them into actionable steps. I will first configure the concept that will lead to discovery which will entail for example user research. Secondly, I will begin to define the problem which will allow me to have an insight as to what exactly users are struggling with, that we could create solutions for.\\n\\nThe third stage will entail the problem statement, which will fully explain the user issue. This will also be the stage in which I will begin to cultivate potential concepts. Lastly, the final stage will consist of finalising the product, with prototypes/ wireframes that will apply the design fundamentals whilst also solving the user issue.\\n\\nWhy did I choose Net A Porter?\\n\\nNet A Porter is notorious and well-known within the fashion industry. It was due to their strong branding that I was familiar with them and considered myself a consumer of their products/services. As a consumer, I was aware of how immersive they were already within the e-commerce industry, therefore considering this, I was keen to observe their strengths and weaknesses. Alongside being a consumer, this also equated to being a user of their services. Whilst navigating both their website and app, I came to the realisation that I felt overwhelmed by the content produced.\\n\\nIt was arguably often cluttered making it not only hard to navigate but also difficult to comprehend. In having this user experience, I wanted to evaluate whether this led to the business having a higher app bounce rate, which is the number of visitors who enter the app and then deter from it rather than continuing onto other pages. If so, then this would be a key performance indicator for the business on their potential usability problems and lower sale numbers, which could ultimately harm the overall business.\\n\\nProblem Statement\\n\\nOverwhelming content and confusing layout that keeps users from fully grasping the information at hand and affecting overall bounce rate.\\n\\nHypothesis\\n\\nBased on the issues raised previously as well as the research I will conduct further, I will attempt to redesign and present variables of Net A Porter\\'s landing page, specifically their home page, as this is the page in which users are often greeted and the dictating point in which they decide to stay and browse or leave. I will attempt this redesign by focusing on their navigation system and overall layout which I will heavily rely on user\\'s comments as well as using the double diamond method. The outcome I am looking to achieve is a pleasant user experience, allowing users to navigate smoothly and purchase products more frequently as a result.\\n\\nBusiness Research-\\n\\nTo gain a deeper understanding of Net-A-Porter as a business, it was crucial to conduct background research on the company. This research provided valuable context for their business needs.\\n\\nThis analysis assesses the products/services and strengths/weaknesses of competitors, aiming to uncover factors contributing to their success. Focusing on both direct and indirect competitors, the analysis provides insights into Net A Porter\\'s competitive landscape.\\n\\nMy findings revealed that Farfetch and Matches Fashion are direct competitors to Net A Porter, whereas Asos are rather indirect competitors. This was because, where Asos targets a similar customer base, they do not have a similar value proposition. The company rather operates within the fast fashion industry and pivots well through trends and being affordable to customers. This is in contrast to Matches Fashion and Farfetch, where similarly to Net A Porter, they are worldwide established e-retailers that offer luxury and suitable products within the same market at a range of price points. They are also known to have large production inventories, to produce their quality products.\\n\\nDespite this, all three companies share similar website/app layouts. For instance, they all have a navigation bar and have the added feature of country/language preferences for users to browse through as well as a \" can we help?\" feature. It is important to note, that this feature is not found within the Net A Porter app but is found on their website, which could be proven critical for users trusting the company\\'s services as they are deemed to be inconsistent with their user features.\\n\\nI next conducted my red route analysis, which is a research method that allows users to determine what feature is a priority to them. This will then guide me on my redesign as they will be based on genuine customer data and what they consider as essential features. In doing this analysis, I conducted three tasks.\\n\\nI first compiled features on e-commerce sites into a list that was derived from the 5 most common features amongst my initial research on the competitors of Net A Porter (ASOS, Matches Fashion & Farfetch). That list was then passed on to individuals who often shopped for clothing online and were between the ages of 18-28. I found it critical to conduct my research based on this target audience because I was adamant that I would receive more concrete and accurate data than supposed individuals who shopped in physical stores or were over the age range. These individuals then ranked the features by numbers, with 1- indicating top priority to 5- indicating least, to which you may see the results below.\\n\\nParticipants were then asked on their reasoning behind their ranking to which they based it on the following; usefulness, necessity and easy to locate.\\n\\nMy second task involved asking the same participants to go onto Net A Porter\\'s website or mobile app and answer the following question, \" In 15 seconds can you name five features you see?\". It is important to note, that not only did all participants choose to do this task by the company\\'s mobile app but the majority of them chose the same features they initially ranked in the previous task, therefore indicating that those sets of features were what users expected from an e-retailer and contributed massively to their overall user experience.\\n\\nThe third task of my user research involved formulating an interview which was handed to the same participants. The interview allowed me to retrieve both qualitative and quantitative data which gave me a better understanding of a user\\'s insights. However, to retrieve this data, I had to ensure that my questions were based on the principle of seeking genuine answers, not answers that were vague or expected. I also based these questions on the data received on my second task and made sure to pose only open-ended questions, which are listed below.\\n\\nThis interview provided concise findings which I found also correlated with my problem statement. Interviewees were overwhelmed by the content found on the Net A Porter app and considered some to be unnecessary. Some had a pre-established mindset on what features should have which weighed heavily on their decision of top 5. In addition, the account feature was seen as personalised settings for browsing, potentially affecting future purchasing decisions.\\n\\nCrazy 8s Method\\n\\nI utilised the ideation technique known as \"Crazy 8s,\" which involves generating 8 alternative approaches or iterations to an issue within 8 minutes. Each design solution is sketched within one minute, facilitating rapid creation of multiple concepts. This technique is inclusive of individuals who may not be designers and encourages swift idea generation. I employed Invision Freehand to create the 8 designs.\\n\\nCard Sorting\\n\\nI employed a website structuring ideation method involving card sorting, wherein participants categorise cards under appropriate headings related to the website\\'s navigation and overall architecture. Using Optimal Workshop, an online card sorting tool, I created cards relevant to Net A Porter\\'s sections and subsections. Categories were selected based on the company\\'s site/app structure for practical referencing. Participants were then asked to complete the exercise, yielding the following results.\\n\\nFollowing my designs created by using the Crazy 8s method, I chose my top 2 designs that I wanted to progress with. Wireframe 1 consisted of combining two designs from my Crazy 8s designs (wireframe 1 & 2). The chosen two designs not only aligned with the given results from the research I conducted but also solved the initial problems whilst uplifting the brand ever so.\\n\\nMid Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nDuring the transition from low-fidelity to mid-fidelity wireframes, I enhanced the visibility and visualisation of my designs, making notable changes to improve user experience. All designs were tailored for mobile and desktop users, through the frames of iphone 13/14 and macbook air 13, with adjustments made to the layout and content presentation. Icons, text, and logos were added to accentuate each section, with a focus on user-friendly navigation, particularly in the mobile app versions.\\n\\nFor wireframe 1, the home section featured the Net A Porter logo, sales/promotion information, and a slideshow highlighting top stories from the blog/editorial editions. Wireframe 2 included additional details such as text for trending items, aiming to provide inventive and predictive features for frequent customers based on past purchases and industry trends.\\n\\nHigh Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nFor my high-fidelity wireframes, I replaced all placeholders with images relevant to Net A Porter, maintaining consistency with the brand\\'s aesthetic. In the mobile versions, I included a menu icon for easy navigation, while the desktop version of wireframe 2, featured all sections visible already to the users. The layout was influenced by the brand\\'s minimalistic approach, addressing issues of overcrowding and ensuring consistency throughout. This approach not only represented Net A Porter effectively but also left me satisfied with the overall outcome.\\n\\nDesign Fundamentals\\n\\nThe laws of UX/UI design are key principles which designers must abide by to fulfil the user experience. Laws that I concentrated on throughout all stages of my designs were:\\n\\nHicks Law- I intended to show the home page as minimal as possible and only contain the information that was necessary to avoid lengthening the user journey by increasing the time it takes the user to make decisions. I understood that the home page set the tone of the user\\'s interaction and also could be seen as a test of users\\' level of tolerance in regards to usability issues, therefore with this considered, I made sure that both of my wireframes were simple as possible for example, through the navigation bar, screen layout.\\n\\nMiller\\'s Law -- According to Miller\\'s law, the average human can keep roughly seven objects in working memory. It\\'s often referred to as the Magical Number 7. It is advantageous to break up content into smaller bits so that individuals can process, remember, and comprehend it more quickly. In regards to my wireframe 2, I wanted to segregate categories under headings to implement this law. I also made sure to only add three trending items alongside the names of their designers on Wireframe 1, to abide by this law.\\n\\nAesthetic Usability Effect- This refers to users\\' belief to perceive aesthetically pleasing products/services as more usable whilst also overlooking minor experience issues. Considering that Net A Porter\\'s home page is also the landing page for users, whilst designing I made sure to impediment a good use of whitespace and not allow darker colours to overtake, to make the brand appeal modern and provide the perception of luxury.\\n\\nTypography\\n\\nThe typography I decided to use was Sans Serif- Inter Tight which was the closest font to the original font on Net A Porter\\'s website/app. The reason why I chose this typeface was because it holds the user\\'s attention and users can interact with the brand\\'s content as it provides easy readability also. In my designs, I mainly used the font in its regular format, with added kerning and lines for hierarchy as well as adequate spacing between my letters. In addition, I used the font\\'s italic and bold format within the article sections for both wireframes .\\n\\nWhilst designing, I needed to reference accessibility guidelines whilst also putting the needs of the users first. The brand\\'s original colour scheme is what stood out to me in regards to accessibility and inclusiveness. They make heavy use of black text on a white background which is known to be harmful to the users due to its intense light levels as research suggests. In light of this, to avoid discomfort for users, I made sure to use a darker shade of grey within my designs, which was acute to the brand\\'s original colour palette to provide an adequate user experience and also obtain the sophisticated image of Net A Porter.\\n\\nFurthermore, my overall design layout for both wireframes was in coherence with the principles of inclusive design. I made sure to create a logical and easy-to-navigate layout that broke down content into subsections, alongside images/banners that drew users in. I stuck to the brand\\'s original language on their website (English), ensuring that my choice of words was non-complex to accommodate users. Similarly, I added a feature to transcribe all text into any language for the brand to reach a greater target audience. The font size was also an important factor, therefore I used the sizes 14, 16px and above for readability and text magnification.\\n\\nMoreover, I wanted to ensure that my designs were suitable for users such as screen readers. In doing so, I created my article section with my hero image and a separate text element on top, as a means of enabling support for screen readers to access the information/content displayed. In addition, my use of large buttons that are set to be interactive and lead users to other sections of the website/app are also another method I used to abide by the principles. The buttons are designed not only to be more notable and distinct to users but to enhance user\\'s experience with them, specifically the text label on them. The text labels can be seen throughout my designs and are easy to comprehend for users.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nI was able to redesign Net A Porter\\'s homepage to solve user issues and provide a better user experience. Through intensive research and innovation, I was able to configure wireframes that were coherent to the brand image of Net A Porter and demonstrated their most valuable assets as a luxury e-commerce brand. I was surprised at the fact that Net A Porter arguably had a poor content layout that resulted in the issue of overcrowdedness, however, nonetheless I was content that I was able to configure designs that solved the issues raised.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed this case study. I was happy at how interactive it was from conducting research to designing wireframes using the adequate tools and applying design principles. In some aspects, I would say that it went well, however I would have liked to implement more laws such as Jacob\\'s law which would have allowed me to indulge more on the competitors of Net A Porter and perhaps the aspects of their website, in which I could get inspiration to improve on my final design. Now knowing the importance of this law, I will try to implement it in my next case study.\\n\\nThis case study pushed me on my UI capability as I was configuring wireframes using methods and resources that I was not familiar with. When constructing my first wireframe draft, it did not go the way that I had expected, however this project gave me the opportunity to enhance my skills through practice and consistency. If I could launch this project and get user feedback from it , I would validate my hypothesis by making use of the A/B testing. To which, would allow me to assess the conversion rate as well user engagement, that could potentially lead to a reduced bouncer rate for Net A Porter.',\n",

To reverse a string in Python, you can use slicing. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nThe slicing notation s[::-1] starts from the end of the string and moves to the beginning, effectively reversing it. It's a concise and efficient way to achieve this.\\n\\nAns. The main difference between a list and a tuple in Python is mutability. A list is mutable, meaning you can change its content after it's created. You can add, remove, or modify elements. Here's an example:\\n\\nOn the other hand, a tuple is immutable. Once it's created, you can't change its content. Tuples are defined using parentheses. Here's an example:\\n\\n# my_tuple.append(4) would raise an error because tuples don't support item assignment\\n\\nChoosing between a list and a tuple depends on whether you need to modify the data. Tuples can also be slightly faster and are often used when the data should not change.\\n\\nAns. To check if a number is prime, you need to test if it's only divisible by 1 and itself. Here's a simple function to do that:\\n\\nThis function first checks if the number is less than or equal to 1, which are not prime numbers. Then it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If any number divides evenly, it's not prime.\\n\\nAns. In Python, == checks for value equality. Meaning, it checks if the values of two variables are the same. For example:\\n\\nOn the other hand, it checks for identity, meaning it checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. For example:\\n\\nThis distinction is important when dealing with mutable objects like lists.\\n\\nAns. Calculating the factorial of a number can be done using either a loop or recursion. Here's an example using a loop:\\n\\nThis function initializes the result to 1 and multiplies it by each integer up to n. It's straightforward and avoids the risk of stack overflow with large numbers that recursion might encounter.\\n\\nAns. Generators are a special type of iterator in Python that allows you to iterate through a sequence of values lazily, meaning they generate values on the fly and save memory. You create a generator using a function and the yield keyword. Here's a simple example:\\n\\nUsing yield instead of return allows the function to produce a series of values over time, pausing and resuming as needed. This is very useful for handling large datasets or streams of data.\\n\\nAns. Both map and filter are built-in functions in Python used for functional programming, but they serve different purposes. The map function applies a given function to all items in an input list (or any iterable) and returns a new list of results. For example:\\n\\nOn the other hand, the filter function applies a given function to all items in an input list and returns only the items for which the function returns True. Here's an example:\\n\\nSo, map transforms each item, while filter selects items based on a condition. Both are very powerful tools for processing data efficiently.\\n\\nCheck out more Python interview questions.\\n\\nAns. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half. Here's how you can implement it in Python:\\n\\nIn this function, we initialize two pointers, left and right, to the start and end of the list, respectively. We then repeatedly check the middle element and adjust the pointers based on the comparison with the target value.\\n\\nAns. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. The main advantage of hash tables is their efficient data retrieval, as they allow for average-case constant-time complexity, O(1), for lookups, insertions, and deletions.\\n\\nHere's a simple example in Python using a dictionary, which is essentially a hash table:\\n\\nIn this example, the hash function is implicitly handled by Python's dictionary implementation. Keys are hashed to produce a unique index where the corresponding value is stored.\\n\\nAns. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Here's a Python implementation:\\n\\nIn this function, we have two nested loops. The inner loop performs the comparisons and swaps, and the outer loop ensures that the process is repeated until the entire list is sorted.\\n\\nAns. Depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) are two fundamental algorithms for traversing or searching through a graph or tree data structure.\\n\\nDFS (Depth-First Search): This algorithm starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure, either implicitly with recursion or explicitly with an iterative approach.\\n\\nBFS (Breadth-First Search): This algorithm starts at the root (or an arbitrary node) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure.\\n\\nThe primary difference is in their approach: DFS goes deep into the graph first, while BFS explores all neighbors at the current depth before going deeper. DFS can be useful for pathfinding and connectivity checking, while BFS is often used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nAns. A linked list is a data structure in which elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Here's how you can implement a simple singly linked list in Python:\\n\\nIn this implementation, we have a Node class to represent each element in the list and a LinkedList class to manage the nodes. The append method adds a new node to the end of the list, and the print_list method prints all elements.\\n\\nAns. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. Here's a recursive function to find the nth Fibonacci number:\\n\\nThis function uses recursion to compute the Fibonacci number. The base cases handle the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1), and the recursive case sums the previous two Fibonacci numbers.\\n\\nAns. Time complexity and space complexity are used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm.\\n\\nTime Complexity: This measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. It's typically expressed using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of the running time. For example, a linear search has a time complexity of O(n), meaning its running time increases linearly with the size of the input.\\n\\nSpace Complexity: This measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. It's also expressed using Big O notation. For example, the space complexity of an algorithm that uses a constant amount of extra memory is O(1).\\n\\nUnderstanding these concepts helps you choose the most efficient algorithm for a given problem, especially when dealing with large datasets or constrained resources.\\n\\nCheck out more interview questions on data structures.\\n\\nAssume the dataset has the following columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country\\n\\nAns. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nAns. Reading a CSV file into a DataFrame is straightforward with Pandas. You use the read_csv function. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nThis function reads the CSV file from the specified path and loads it into a DataFrame, which is a powerful data structure for data manipulation and analysis.\\n\\nAns. Selecting specific rows and columns in a DataFrame can be done using various methods. Here are a few examples:\\n\\nThese methods allow you to access and manipulate specific parts of your data efficiently.\\n\\nAns. The main difference between loc and iloc lies in how you select data from a DataFrame:\\n\\nloc: Uses labels or boolean arrays to select data. It is label-based.\\n\\niloc: Uses integer positions to select data. It is position-based.\\n\\nEssentially, loc is used when you know the labels of your data, and iloc is used when you know the index positions.\\n\\nAns. Handling missing values is crucial for data analysis. Pandas provides several methods to deal with missing data.\\n\\nThese methods allow you to clean your data, making it ready for analysis.\\n\\nAns. To merge two DataFrames, you can use the merge function, which is similar to SQL joins. Here's an example:\\n\\nIn this example, how='inner' specifies an inner join. You can also use 'left', 'right', or 'outer' for different types of joins.\\n\\nAns. The groupby function in Pandas is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria, apply a function to each group, and then combine the results. Here's a simple example:\\n\\nIn this example, the DataFrame is grouped by the 'Category' column, and the sum of the 'Values' column is calculated for each group. Grouping data is very powerful for aggregation and summary statistics.\\n\\nAns. Creating a NumPy array is straightforward. You can use the array function from the NumPy library. Here's an example:\\n\\nThis code converts a Python list into a NumPy array. You can also create arrays with specific shapes and values using functions like np.zeros, np.ones, and np.arange.\\n\\nAns. While both Python lists and NumPy arrays can store collections of items, there are key differences between them:\\n\\nHere's an example comparing a Python list and a NumPy array:\\n\\nNumPy arrays are the go-to for performance-critical applications, especially in data science and numerical computing.\\n\\nAns. Element-wise operations in NumPy are straightforward and efficient. NumPy allows you to perform operations directly on arrays without the need for explicit loops. Here's an example:\\n\\nIn this example, addition and multiplication are performed element-wise, meaning each element of array1 is added to the corresponding element of array2, and the same for multiplication.\\n\\nAns. Broadcasting is a powerful feature in NumPy that allows you to perform operations on arrays of different shapes. NumPy automatically expands the smaller array to match the shape of the larger array without making copies of data. Here's an example:\\n\\nThe output will be:\\n\\nIn this example, array1 is broadcasted across array2 to perform element-wise addition. Broadcasting simplifies code and improves efficiency.\\n\\nAns. Transposing an array means swapping its rows and columns. You can use the transpose method or the .T attribute. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nThe output will be:\\n\\nThis operation is particularly useful in linear algebra and data manipulation.\\n\\nAns. Matrix multiplication in NumPy can be performed using the dot function or the @ operator. Here's an example:\\n\\nThe output will be:\\n\\nMatrix multiplication combines rows of the first matrix with columns of the second matrix, which is a common operation in various numerical and machine-learning applications.\\n\\nAns: Here's how you write the query for it:\\n\\nAns. To select all records from a table, you use the SELECT statement with the asterisk (*) wildcard, which means 'all columns'. Here's the syntax:\\n\\nFor example, if you have a table named employees, the query would be:\\n\\nThis query retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table.\\n\\nAns. Both GROUP BY and HAVING are used in SQL to organize and filter data, but they serve different purposes:\\n\\nGROUP BY: This clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into aggregated data. It is often used with aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.\\n\\nHAVING: This clause is used to filter groups created by the GROUP BY clause. It acts like a WHERE clause, but is used after the aggregation.\\n\\nIn summary, GROUP BY creates the groups, and HAVING filters those groups based on a condition.\\n\\nAns. To find the second-highest salary, you can use the LIMIT clause along with a subquery. Here's one way to do it:\\n\\nThis query first finds the highest salary and then uses it to find the maximum salary that is less than this highest salary, effectively giving you the second-highest salary.\\n\\nAns. These JOIN operations are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them:\\n\\nINNER JOIN: Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.\\n\\nLEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the left table, and the matched rows from the right table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.\\n\\nRIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN): Returns all rows from the right table, and the matched rows from the left table. If no match is found, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.\\n\\nThese different JOIN types help in retrieving the data as per the specific needs of the query.\\n\\nAns. To count the number of employees in each department, you can use the GROUP BY clause along with the COUNT function. Here's how:\\n\\nThis query groups the employees by their department and counts the number of employees in each group.\\n\\nAns. A subquery, or inner query, is a query nested within another query. It can be used in various places like the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, or inside other subqueries. Here's an example:\\n\\nIn this example, the subquery (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) calculates the average salary of all employees. The outer query then selects the names and salaries of employees who earn more than this average salary.\\n\\nCheck out more SQL coding questions.\\n\\nAns. Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns not only the underlying patterns in the training data but also the noise and outliers. This results in excellent performance on the training data but poor generalization to new, unseen data. Here are a few strategies to prevent overfitting:\\n\\nPreventing overfitting is crucial for building robust models that perform well on new data.\\n\\nAns. Supervised and unsupervised learning are two fundamental types of machine learning.\\n\\nSupervised Learning: In this approach, the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that each training example comes with an associated output label. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common tasks include classification and regression.\\n\\nUnsupervised Learning: In this approach, the model is trained on data without labeled responses. The goal is to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in the input data. Common tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.\\n\\nThe main difference lies in the presence or absence of labeled outputs during training. Supervised learning is used when the goal is prediction, while unsupervised learning is used for discovering patterns.\\n\\nAns. Classification and regression are both types of supervised learning tasks, but they serve different purposes.\\n\\nClassification: This involves predicting a categorical outcome. The goal is to assign inputs to one of a set of predefined classes.\\n\\nRegression: This involves predicting a continuous outcome. The goal is to predict a numeric value based on input features.\\n\\nIn summary, classification predicts discrete labels, while regression predicts continuous values.\\n\\nAns. I used an example DataFrame df with three features. Performed PCA to reduce the dimensionality to 2 components using PCA from sklearn and plotted the first two principal components using matplotlib. Here's how you can do it:\\n\\nAns. Evaluating a machine learning model involves several metrics and techniques to ensure its performance. Here are some common methods:\\n\\nTrain-Test Split: Divide the dataset into a training set and a test set to evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen data.\\n\\nCross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\\n\\nConfusion Matrix: For classification problems, a confusion matrix helps visualize the performance by showing true vs. predicted values.\\n\\nROC-AUC Curve: For binary classification, the ROC-AUC curve helps evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between classes.\\n\\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): For regression problems, these metrics help quantify the prediction errors.\\n\\nEvaluating a model comprehensively ensures that it performs well not just on training data but also on new, unseen data, making it robust and reliable.\\n\\nCheck out more machine learning interview questions.\\n\\nMastering coding questions in data science is essential to get the job you want in this ever-changing industry.

       "    'title': 'Humanity 2.0 by Ray Kurzweil',\n",
       "    'body': 'Ray Kurzweil\\'s book \"Humanity 2.0\" is a comprehensive study on how humanity is being transformed by technology and what we might encounter in the future. In this article, I wanted to discuss it because, in an era where artificial intelligence is advancing so rapidly, I was deeply impressed by this book written with Kurzweil\\'s vision. Concepts like technological singularity, human-machine merging, and digital immortality aim to redefine the evolution of humanity. In this article, we will examine Kurzweil\\'s predictions and the social, ethical, and economic impacts of these predictions in detail.\\n\\nTechnological singularity lies at the core of Kurzweil\\'s predictions. The singularity, predicted to occur in 2045 when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, holds great opportunities and potential risks for humanity. Kurzweil foresees that during this period, artificial intelligence will not only surpass human intelligence but will also fundamentally change the human experience through human-machine merging. In a post-singularity world, humans will transcend their biological limitations and enter a new evolutionary phase.\\n\\nThe Law of Exponential Growth:\\n\\nKurzweil argues that technological advancement follows exponential growth and that this growth has transformed technological developments throughout human history. Exponential growth means that technology advances rapidly and at an accelerating pace each year. This indicates a future where technology increasingly impacts human life. Kurzweil believes this growth is inevitable and that technology will fundamentally change human life.\\n\\nHuman-Machine Merging:\\n\\nHuman-machine merging refers to the integration of the human body and mind with technology and is one of the cornerstones of Humanity 2.0. Advanced technologies such as brain-machine interfaces, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering have the potential to enhance human physical and cognitive abilities. Kurzweil argues that these technologies will extend human life and bring us closer to immortality. Nanobots will circulate in the body, treating diseases and improving biological functions. This technology will enable humans to overcome biological limitations and live longer and healthier lives. Kurzweil predicts that brain-machine interfaces will be widely used by the 2030s and that these technologies will significantly enhance human mental capacities. People will be able to control machines directly with their thoughts, enhancing their mental abilities and solving more complex problems. Genetic engineering will allow the human genetic code to be rewritten, eliminating undesirable genetic traits. By the 2030s, genetic editing technologies like CRISPR will be widely used to restructure the human genome. This merging will expand human potential, allowing individuals to be endowed with genetically designed traits.\\n\\nBrain-Machine Interfaces:\\n\\nThe integration of the human body and mind with technology is a cornerstone of Humanity 2.0. Brain-machine interfaces, nanotechnology, and genetic engineering will enhance human physical and cognitive abilities. Kurzweil argues that these technologies will extend human life and bring us closer to immortality. Nanobots will circulate in the body, treating diseases and improving biological functions. This technology will enable humans to overcome biological limitations and live longer and healthier lives.\\n\\nGenetic and Biotechnological Advances:\\n\\nGenetic engineering and biotechnology hold great potential for eliminating human diseases and enhancing human abilities. Humans will be able to change their biological structures through genetic engineering to become healthier and more capable individuals. Kurzweil argues that these technologies will play a key role in surpassing the limits of human biology. Genetic engineering will allow the human genetic code to be rewritten, eliminating undesirable genetic traits. Kurzweil predicts that by the 2030s, genetic editing technologies like CRISPR will be widely used to restructure the human genome.\\n\\nDigital Immortality\\n\\nDigital immortality is the concept of transferring human consciousness to digital environments, marking a major revolution in the world of technology and philosophy. This idea, proposed by Ray Kurzweil in \"Humanity 2.0,\" points to a future where humanity transcends biological limitations to achieve eternal existence. Digital immortality is based on the idea of backing up human consciousness in digital format. In this process, individuals\\' memories, experiences, and consciousness are transferred to digital environments, allowing this data to exist even after the physical body\\'s death. Kurzweil predicts that this technology will become possible by the 2040s. This will fundamentally change the concept of death, giving people the chance to exist independently of their physical bodies. A range of advanced technologies is required to realize the concept of digital immortality. These technologies include brain-machine interfaces, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, and advanced data storage techniques. Brain-machine interfaces enable people to transfer their thoughts directly to digital environments. Artificial intelligence allows these digital minds to exist independently and continue to learn. Nanotechnology maps the detailed connections of brain cells and nerves for digitization. Digital immortality has profound effects on ethical and social values. As the meaning of being human and the boundaries of human nature are redefined, the ethical dimensions of these transformations are frequently debated. The digitalization of human identity raises important questions about privacy and individual freedom. While digital immortality allows individuals to preserve their consciousness forever, concerns about the security and privacy of these consciousnesses also increase. Kurzweil emphasizes that the ethical dimensions of technology should not be overlooked. He argues that the impacts of technological transformations on human rights, privacy, and individual freedoms should be carefully examined. The digitization of mental processes brings significant questions about human rights and ethical values. Therefore, ethical guidance and regulations are essential in developing digital immortality technologies. Digital immortality has the potential to fundamentally change social structures and individuals\\' lifestyles. The existence of digital minds can replace physical bodies, leading to the redefinition of social interactions, work life, and personal identity. Virtual reality and digital immortality will enable people to socialize and work without being physically present, causing significant changes in business and social interactions. Inequalities in access to technological advancements can deepen social and economic disparities. If digital immortality is available only to a certain segment of society, it can create new class divisions. Therefore, the fair and equal distribution of technology is crucial for humanity. Kurzweil emphasizes the need for global equality in this regard. The dependency on technology and the risks it brings are also important topics of discussion.\\n\\nThe Digital Backup of Minds:\\n\\nKurzweil argues that human consciousness can be transferred to digital environments, thus escaping biological limitations. This will enable individuals to achieve immortality and change traditional understandings of life and death. Digital backup of minds will allow humans to exist independently of their physical bodies. This process will be realized by converting human consciousness and memories into digital format. Kurzweil predicts that digital immortality will enable human consciousness to exist forever, and this will become possible in the 2040s.\\n\\nSocial and Ethical Impacts\\n\\nEthical Issues:\\n\\nConcepts such as human-machine merging and digital immortality create profound impacts on ethical and social values. As the meaning of being human and the boundaries of human nature are redefined, the ethical dimensions of these transformations are frequently debated. The impact of technology on human identity and issues like privacy and individual freedom are of great importance. Kurzweil\\'s predictions highlight the profound effects of technology on individuals and societies. For example, how brain-machine interfaces will affect mental privacy and the ethical dimensions of digital immortality lead to extensive discussions. Kurzweil emphasizes that the ethical dimensions of technology should not be overlooked. He argues that the impacts of technological transformations on human rights, privacy, and individual freedoms should be carefully examined. These issues require deep reflection on what technological advancements mean for humanity. The genetic modification of humans and the digitization of mental processes raise significant questions about human rights and ethical values.\\n\\nSocial Changes\\n\\nThe concept of digital immortality has the potential to fundamentally change social structures and individuals\\' lifestyles. The existence of digital minds can replace physical bodies, leading to the redefinition of social interactions, work life, and personal identity.\\n\\nWork Life and Social Interactions:\\n\\nVirtual reality and digital immortality will enable people to socialize and work without being physically present, causing significant changes in business and social interactions. People will be able to work in virtual offices, maintaining their professional lives independently of physical spaces. This situation could lead to fundamental changes in the structure of cities, as the need for physical workplaces decreases and people interact more in virtual environments.\\n\\nEducation and Learning:\\n\\nDigital immortality and virtual reality technologies can also revolutionize education. Students can receive education in virtual classrooms, interacting with the best teachers from around the world. This will increase access to education and provide equal opportunities in education. Additionally, the sharing of knowledge and experiences by digital minds will accelerate and make the learning process more effective.\\n\\nSocial Isolation and Human Relationships:\\n\\nDigital immortality can lead to people detaching from the physical world and causing social isolation. The increase in time spent in virtual reality can reduce real-world social interactions. This situation can fundamentally change the nature of human relationships and lead to an increase in issues such as loneliness in society. As people spend more time in the digital world, the weakening of bonds in the physical world may occur. Therefore, maintaining a balance between the digital and physical worlds is important.\\n\\nIdentity and Social Roles:\\n\\nDigital immortality will require individuals to redefine their identities and social roles. A mind existing in a digital environment can maintain its identity independently of the physical world\\'s limitations. This can bring about an understanding of identity beyond biological factors such as gender and age. People can adopt new identities and roles in the digital world, leading to the reshaping of social norms and values.\\n\\nAccess and Inequality:\\n\\nInequalities in access to technological advancements can deepen social and economic disparities. If digital immortality is available only to a certain segment of society, it can create new class divisions. Therefore, the fair and equal distribution of technology is crucial for humanity. Equal access to technological opportunities is important for social peace and justice. Kurzweil emphasizes the need for global equality in this regard. He warns that technological inequalities can lead to larger social and economic problems globally.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nIn conclusion, digital immortality holds great potential for humanity while requiring careful management of the social changes it brings. The existence of humans in the digital world will fundamentally change social interactions, work life, and the understanding of identity. Therefore, it is essential not to overlook the ethical and social dimensions in developing digital immortality technologies.\\n\\nTechnological Dependency:\\n\\nDigital immortality and related technologies have the potential to increase people\\'s dependency on technology. This situation can threaten individuals\\' freedoms and privacy. Technological dependency can deeply affect individuals\\' daily lives and negatively impact human relationships and social bonds. Kurzweil predicts that digital immortality will increase people\\'s interaction with technology and that technological dependency will rise as these technologies become widespread. Another aspect of technological dependency is that people will spend more time in the digital world, detaching from the physical world. Concepts such as virtual reality and digital immortality can weaken people\\'s ties to the real world, leading to social isolation. As people spend more time in the digital world, they may neglect their social interactions in the physical world. This situation can weaken social bonds and increase psychological issues such as loneliness. Therefore, maintaining a balance between the digital and physical worlds is of great importance.\\n\\nDigital immortality requires individuals to transfer their consciousness to digital environments. This situation can endanger individuals\\' privacy and the security of personal data. Consciousness and memories stored in digital environments can be targeted by malicious individuals or organizations. Therefore, protecting digital security and privacy is crucial in developing digital immortality technologies.\\n\\nPsychological Impacts:\\n\\nIncreasing dependency on technology can have negative impacts on individuals\\' psychological health. Continuous digital interaction can lead to psychological issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, the blurring of differences between the virtual and real worlds can disrupt individuals\\' perception of reality and negatively affect psychological balance.\\n\\nSocial Bonds:\\n\\nTechnological dependency can weaken social bonds. As people spend more time in the digital world, face-to-face interactions may decrease. This situation can weaken family bonds and friendship relationships. Societies may replace traditional social bonds with virtual connections as digital interactions increase.\\n\\nKurzweil emphasizes the need to minimize the negative impacts of technology on human life. It is important to carefully evaluate the impacts of technological transformations on human relationships and social bonds. Therefore, a conscious and balanced approach should be adopted to protect human psychology and social structures in developing digital immortality technologies. While technology has the potential to improve human life, serious social and psychological problems can arise if this potential is not managed correctly.\\n\\nThe Impact of Digital Immortality:\\n\\nCarefully considering the social and psychological impacts of digital immortality and related technologies will ensure these technologies are used responsibly and ethically in the future. Comprehensive studies and regulations are needed to ensure the societal acceptance of digital immortality and individuals\\' adaptation to this technology.',\n",

       "    'title': 'The Peer Review System of Academia',\n",
       "    'body': 'Greetings, my fellow science enthusiast! You may have heard of scientists, journalists and some conspiracy theorists talking about peer reviews. While some treat peer review as a stamp of approval by the \"science gods\", some dismiss it entirely as a useless hindrance to scientific progress. Who is right? Is it really black or white? Are there nuances that both sides are missing? In this article, I write my thoughts and opinions on the system, with nuances that people commonly miss.\\n\\nAcademia is a platform for engaging in a scientific discourse on a topic of one\\'s choice. Academic freedom essentially refers to the freedom of choice of the topic one wants to study, the methodologies one wants to use, what to publish, what not to publish, and the journal or a conference one wants to publish at, and so on. The goal of academia is to produce new knowledge, which could include new ideas, or new perspectives on existing knowledge. While this sounds wonderful, and it may sound like anyone could do literally anything at a university, that is not true. While there are numerous valid ways to conduct research, infinitely many choices of tools one would want to use and ways to frame their research questions, there are some do\\'s and don\\'ts when it comes to academic freedom. A certain standard must be met, but we don\\'t really have a reasonable way of setting and evaluating standards, and nobody holds the authority to dictate what is right or wrong. However, it is intended that a scientific study must reveal something we didn\\'t already know, and it must not be misleading. The entire academic community is on the same page in this regard.\\n\\nThat begs the question -- How exactly do we ensure that a study reveals some new information that was not already known, and it\\'s not misleading? The answer, unfortunately is not a simple one. Peer review, while not foolproof, plays a critical role in safeguarding research integrity. While absolute certainty is elusive, science thrives on progress. We constantly seek to minimize misunderstandings and refine our understanding of the world. Here\\'s where peer review steps in: a crucial process that helps us navigate the complexities of research, even though it has limitations. What is it and how does it work? What is its role in the world we live in, and what are its limitations? In this opinion piece, I would like to shed light on these aspects primarily for those from non-academic backgrounds.\\n\\nPeer review is a form of quality evaluation in academia, and one of its purposes is to evaluate whether a study is worthy of publication in its current format or with reasonable changes. It is quite similar to a teacher evaluating a primary school student\\'s answer script, to see if they would pass or not. While exam evaluations are done in a rather authoritarian setting, peer review is more similar to students reading and evaluating each other\\'s essays. After all, the more important purpose of peer review is for authors to get validation or constructive criticism from diverse sources regarding the research methodology, data analysis, and overall conclusions.\\n\\nUniversities thrive in an environment of continuous improvement. Peer review plays a vital role in maintaining high academic standards. Strong research, vetted through rigorous peer review, establishes a university\\'s reputation for excellence. This reputation attracts talented researchers, students, and funding, all of which contribute to a university\\'s growth and sustainability.\\n\\nIn an informal sense, you could write a manuscript of a research work you conducted, and ask your colleague or supervisor to review it. Technically, this is an obvious case of a \"peer\" reviewing your work, but it does not hold much significance on its own. Formal peer review plays a role in publishing research findings. A publication could be a thesis published at a university, or a paper published at an academic research conference or a journal. Irrespective of the venue, peer review involves similar steps:\\n\\nSubmission: Researchers submit their manuscript (written research work) to a relevant journal or conference.\\n\\nReviewer Selection: Journal editors or conference area chairs find qualified reviewers with expertise in the research topic. These reviewers are typically academics from other institutions whose area of research and qualifications indicates they will understand the manuscript.\\n\\nThe review process: Reviewers assess the manuscripts evaluating its methodology, data analysis, and conclusions. They provide written feedback to the editor, highlighting strengths and suggesting improvements to the authors.\\n\\nDecision: Based on the reviewers\\' feedback, the editor or chair makes a decision: accept the paper for publication, request revisions, or reject the paper.\\n\\nThe format of peer review and the level of scrutiny can drastically vary based on where one attempts to publish their work. There are many types of peer review formats, which can be categorized into single-blind reviews, double-blind reviews, and open reviews. Each of these formats have their own advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\nSingle-blind review: In this format, The reviewers no the identity of the authors, but the authors wouldn\\'t know who the reviewers are. Assuming the reviewers are honest and fair, this format allows the reviewers to have a reasonable prior expectation on the kind of work, and familiarity saves time for the reviewers. However, it may introduce an unfair bias for or against certain authors or the institutions they are from, perhaps based on their reputation. This may affect the decision-making of the reviewers in an unfair way.\\n\\nDouble-blind review: In this format, In addition to the reviewers\\' identities, The authors identities are also hidden from the reviewers. It is required for the authors take necessary efforts in anonymizing their work. To an extent, this format helps mitigate unwanted biases.\\n\\nOpen review: A rather new format is open review, where all the manuscripts submitted to a conference are publicly uploaded to the website, and all qualified members of the community are free to read and comment on the manuscripts. The identities of the reviewers are also made known to the public. This ensures that the reviewers are more careful in their choice of words and provide honest criticism in respectful language, as their reputation as a researcher is also at stake. In theory, this format would ensure better quality of reviews.\\n\\nPeer review is often seen as a golden seal of approval, a guarantee of a study\\'s validity. While it\\'s a crucial cornerstone of academic quality control, it\\'s important to understand its limitations. Reviewers are human, and subjectivity can play a role. Their own expertise, biases, and even mood can influence their assessment. Imagine two reviewers -- one a seasoned expert accustomed to established methods, and the other a young researcher open to new ideas. The same paper might receive vastly different feedback.\\n\\nThis also doesn\\'t mean that peer review is a broken system. Despite the possibility of errors, it remains a valuable tool for weeding out flawed research. In most cases, the process helps identify weaknesses, leading to revisions or rejection. This ensures that published research generally adheres to sound methodologies and contributes valuable knowledge to the field. However, it\\'s essential to remember that peer review isn\\'t foolproof. Occasionally, flawed papers might slip through the cracks and get published. Also, valid, groundbreaking, paradigm-shifting research might get brutally rejected.\\n\\nBut the peer review process is designed in a way that in most cases, these situations do not arise. A decision to accept most likely indicates that the contribution of the paper is useful, and does not have major flaws. If a study is flawed, the flaws will likely be revealed during the peer review process, the paper will be rejected, and the authors will have an opportunity to address those flaws, revise and resubmit their manuscript.\\n\\nThe dark side of academia -- While peer review aims for high standards, there are opportunities for exploitation. Relentless resubmissions and predatory journals, which publish papers without proper review or for a fee, threaten the integrity of the system. Academic fraud is a huge concern. Plagiarism, faking data and surveys, and other dishonest practices may be prevalent. Unfortunately, some stakeholders outside academia might not be able to distinguish legitimate journals from predatory ones. This creates a market for these predatory journals, as long as there are researchers willing to pay for a quick publication, potentially to inflate their credentials. Furthermore, pseudoscience streams have their own journals which are essentially echo chambers. The good news is that the honest scientific research community actively identifies predatory journals, and do not take pseudoscience echo-chamber journals seriously. Over time, academics who value their reputation will avoid them. Additionally, initiatives like \"Think. Check. Submit.\" (https://thinkchecksubmit.org/journals/) help researchers identify reputable journals.\\n\\nAcademic fraud may be caught months or years after the manuscript is published, which would call for the retraction of the paper from the journal. When fraud is exposed, the journal issues a retraction notice, essentially a red flag stating that the research is no longer considered valid. An important nuance worth pointing out here is that retraction doesn\\'t necessarily mean a complete removal of the paper. Many journals simply add a watermark that says \"RETRACTED\", and the article will still be available, albeit with a note stating the reason for retraction.\\n\\nThe question of what constitutes reasonable grounds for retracting a peer-reviewed paper remains a heated debate. While clear cases of misconduct (e.g., fabricated data) warrant immediate action, less clear-cut situations present a challenge. When many scientists and doctors take efforts to write to a journal\\'s chief editor raising concerns about a paper\\'s misleading potential, a serious investigation is needed at the very least. Imagine a seemingly valid but poorly designed study, particularly one with potential negative social impact, by a group associated with an alternative medicine community, which is rightly considered as pseudoscience by the scientific medicine community. This study might cleverly avoid explicitly stating a causal link between vaccines and adverse events but instead use phrases like \"further research is required,\" implying a connection without evidence. Studies by the pseudoscience community, especially those with a history of promoting alternative medicine, might be more susceptible to bias and a vested interest in undermining trust in vaccines.\\n\\nIn such cases, retraction becomes a delicate balancing act. There might not be clear evidence of fabrication, but the study\\'s framing and potential for misleading the public are significant concerns. The journal\\'s editorial board would need to carefully weigh the evidence, the potential for harm, and the precedent set by retraction.\\n\\nWhile academic freedom is essential, it doesn\\'t extend to the right to publish misleading information, especially when public health is at stake. A poorly designed study with the potential to discourage vaccination could have serious public health consequences. In such cases, protecting public health often takes precedence over concerns about academic freedom. Researchers can still pursue their work and publish it in relevant alternative medicine journals, but such publications wouldn\\'t carry the same weight as a peer-reviewed journal.\\n\\nThe decision to retract a published paper is rarely straightforward. Factors beyond mere study quality and censorship concerns must be considered. The journal\\'s editor-in-chief, with the editorial board, makes the final call, a decision that must be respected by everyone involved, whether we may agree or not.\\n\\nWell, I hope you learnt something insightful today. If you did, kindly like, comment and share it with your fellow science enthusiasts!',\n",

       "    'title': 'Home Aid- A UX/UI Case Study',\n",
       "    'body': 'Being without a permanent, secure, and functional place to live is referred to as homelessness or houselessness. Rough sleeping, which includes sleeping in vehicles or other non-human habitations like stairwells or public spaces, is often its most obvious form. Nevertheless there are other types of homelessness as well, which are frequently overlooked such as hidden homelessness. This is due to the fact that the majority of individuals who experience homelessness are not included in official statistics; as a result, they are unlikely to request or be eligible for housing assistance. Numerous individuals sleep in public transportation, hostels, squats, and other inappropriate places, or they \"sofa surf\" with friends and relatives.\\n\\nFor an array of factors, individuals are more probable to become homeless. Social factors include things such as lack of affordable housing, unemployment, distinct personal circumstances, and issues with mental and physical health. Individuals that are driven into homelessness include people who leave prison, care facilities, or the army without having an adequate place to live, as well as those who are in domestic violence situations, refugees, and many more groups, according to crisis.org.uk.\\n\\nHow has it changed over the past 10 years?\\n\\nBased on information gathered by the Ministry of Communities Housing and Local Government, there are currently 12 persons sleeping on the streets for every ten that there were ten years ago. The population of people experiencing hidden homelessness is constantly increasing, consequently the actual figure is likely substantially higher and indicates a significant increase in the issue in recent years. Along with its rise has come an increase in the need for healthcare for those without a stable address -- a group that shares many characteristics with rough sleepers. Recent data shows that this increase has increased to a factor of roughly 3.5 since 2010/11. This is consistent with the mostrecent study on the precise medical issues observed in people who were rough sleeping in Westminster in 2023.\\n\\nWhat impact has COVID-19 had on the homelessness?\\n\\nGlobally, COVID-19 has had a positive impact on homelessness. Under the \"Everyone in\" campaign, the government\\'s primary approach to the issue was to support those who were sleeping on the streets. The initiative gave local authorities broad instructions to accommodate the \"37,000\" people who were being evacuated to hotels and other accommodations in the UK in order to safeguard them during the pandemic.\\n\\nHowever, Anderson 2022 claims that, considering the scope and intensity of the program, the overall drop in the number of persons observed sleeping outside was less than anticipated, therefore in the long term, this did not matter. This was partly brought about by the expansive scope of the Everyone In response, a large number of individuals were found who, in the past, would have been assumed to either not meet the legal requirements for accommodations or to not have been contacted by outreach teams. Some individuals decided that the provided shelter was unsuitable and returned back to sleeping outside.\\n\\nWhat am I going to do?\\n\\nI intend to develop an app for this project that will attempt to relieve the burden that comes with homelessness. I\\'ll suggest a user experience that helps and informs users about essential information that can help someone who is in risk of homelessness. The application ought to be user-friendly and captivating, taking into account hardware-enabled components like social media capabilities, NFC, Bluetooth, and geolocation services, among others, as means to expand the app\\'s functionality.\\n\\nThe deliverables I will be presenting will be 3 screens: the home screen and the two other screens. In addition, I\\'ll be using the Double Diamond Process approach to offer significant information regarding my user research and design methodology. Additionally, I\\'ll be performing my own research on other websites and apps created to tackle homelessness, which I\\'ll then utilise and integrate into my own design configurations to meet user needs and lessen the burden of homelessness.\\n\\nThe problem statement\\n\\nIn order to lower their chances of homelessness, people who have just been released from care, prison, hospitals or fled from domestic situations, need some way to guarantee successful local community integration.\\n\\nHypothesis -\\n\\nTo achieve the objective of the project, I will carry out a variety of research methods, including user, secondary, and business research, in order to create an app that supportsand educates those whose lives are at risk of homelessness. With the support of useful resources, I hope this app will serve as a long-term guide that will eventually assist users in lowering their risk substantially or in getting off the streets entirely.\\n\\nMy outcomes for the app are to make it simple, easy to use, accessible to those with cognitive, auditory, and visual impairments, age- and gender-neutral, and provide a seamless user experience.\\n\\nCompetitor Analysis -\\n\\nConducting a competitor analysis, which is a method for gathering quantitative and qualitative data about a company\\'s direct and indirect competitors and their goods and services, will be my initial point of research. Indirect competitors, on the other hand, are businesses that may make comparable goods but do not operate in the same industry as direct competitors. Direct competitors are businesses that share the same industry, products, or services. This analysis aids in determining their strengths and weaknesses as well as what specifically propels company success and what can be avoided. In regards to the app, this will aid me in making adequate decisions for its\\' design and function.\\n\\nMy analysis on competitors associated with combating homelessness can be viewed below;\\n\\nCompetitor Analysis Findings\\n\\nAll of the apps have a fairly comparable layout. They are user friendly, and within first use, they immediately request GPS location to find the best options for the user and provide local services that offer support and in the case of Too Good To Go- local cafes/restaurants. These are excellent illustrations of applications that prioritise the requirements of their users -- in this case, rough sleepers and individuals who face homelessness -- by considering all relevant factors from their point of view. They understand how crucial it is to make their apps fully functional, particularly in emergency situations and for the purpose of safeguarding individuals.\\n\\nFurthermore, the apps employ icons, particularly on their landing (home) pages, to promote interaction and provide a rapid flow of information. They also utilise the addition of hamburger menus, which are a typical element of mobile app designs. With the exception of Street Link, every app has a filter function that lets users save time by selecting only those that meet certain requirements.\\n\\nIt was unexpected to learn from my research that there hadn\\'t been many apps created to help the homeless, or that there were some that had not yet been built or were not available in my region. With the exception of Street Link and Too Good To Go, two applications had not received any reviews out of all the ones I was able to locate and analyse. In a Charity Crisis evaluation, it was found that although 87% of outreach teams had a \"positive impression\" of Street Link, just 33% of rough sleepers shared this sentiment, with more than half viewing it negatively since it was not quick or simple.\\n\\nFurthermore, It was surprising to discover that, despite being an indirect rival, Too Good To Go was the most popular app of the ones I had chosen. Users have given the app a high rating of 4.9/5 because they consider it to be highly useful and convenient. This has led to great engagement and positive feedback, which you can see below.\\n\\nUser Research\\n\\nSince I lacked the means to undertake primary research, I made the decision to concentrate only on acquiring secondary data in order to obtain a better accurate picture of homelessness in the modern world and the problems that affect those who experience it.\\n\\nI have discovered that one issue that homeless individuals frequently deal with is the deterioration of their health and access to medical care. Homeless.org claims that such individuals have lower physical and mental health than the general public, which results in poor diagnoses and more obstacles to receiving care. Additionally, a report from the Office of National Statistics in 2021 backs up this claim. When compared to the general population of England and Wales, the findings demonstrated that over twice as many persons who were classified as homeless reported having poor or very poor health.\\n\\nSimilarly, a local HealthWatch report from recently on 1,200 homeless people discovered that one of the problems keeping people from accessing healthcare assistance is that they cannot provide a valid address or appropriate identification. Furthermore, some GP practices decline to register persons without an address, despite the fact they are not legally required to do so in order to become a patient. This highlights covert prejudice in the healthcare system towards those who are homeless.\\n\\nAs I conducted this research, it became abundantly evident to me from the previously mentioned issue that the repercussions of homelessness vary from case to case. In the words of one homeless person who spoke with the Guardian, \"No two stories are similar and there seems to be no predictable path from a comfortable home to a life on the streets.\"\\n\\nIn addition, basic needs, income, and access to food and shelter are major problems faced by the homeless population. Living on the streets puts additional pressure on them due to their lack of resources, namely income. They also lack a place to call home and are consumed with finding a way to feed themselves constantly. All of this causes their fundamental needs -- clean clothes, water, and food -- to be disregarded, which makes it harder for them to escape this situation.\\n\\nUser Persona\\n\\nIn ux design, user personas are an essential element that stem from qualitative user research. Making a persona will assist me as a designer in comprehending the demands, experiences, behaviours, as well as goals of my users. It will enable me to provoke strong emotions while encouraging connection with the audience I am targeting. I was able to develop a persona that will direct me through my ideation process and help me develop ideas that offer a fairly positive user experience by leveraging the secondary research I gathered.\\n\\nMind Map\\n\\nI created a mind map as my initial ideation technique. Mind maps are useful for swiftly adding and arranging ideas and thoughts in a format that is easy to look back on and expand upon. It was helpful to me in my instance since it provided me with a better understanding of the features, functionality, and scope of my application.\\n\\nUser Flow\\n\\nI had a much clearer notion of the features I wanted my app to include given that I had previously constructed a mind map, therefore my next ideation technique was to develop a user flow. I was able to map out the user\\'s journey through the application using the user flow, including every step they took from the point of entry to the last interaction.\\n\\nIt was essential to me to take into account the user persona I developed and the findings from the secondary research when creating the user flow. By doing this, I was able to ensure that I remained on course while addressing the demands of the users throughout the design process, and I also gained a deeper understanding and empathy for users.\\n\\nCrazy 8s\\n\\nI choose to brainstorm ideas into visual designs using the crazy 8s method. Using an 8-minute timer, this technique involves drawing 8 distinct designs, ideally spending 1 minute on each design. This method makes it possible for non-designers to participate and generates a large number of concepts quickly. I found it difficult to precisely arrange the content of my designs, so after experimenting with this method, I also used the straw man proposal to add further details to improve the clarity and visual appeal of my designs.\\n\\nStraw Man Proposal\\n\\nThe straw man approach is frequently used to address user issues in a more methodical way. Design teams can discuss, breakdown, and refine their work using this technique, which focuses on potential innovations, improvements, or adjustments based on an initial draft. The process involves getting participants together and having each person work on a design for ten minutes at a time. The group gets together when the allotted time is up and discusses insightful feedback. In my instance, I drew up one of my crazy 8s home screen concepts once more and spent ten minutes refining it.\\n\\nWireframing Phase\\n\\nIn this phase, I took care to develop designs on frames that, assuming their\\n\\ncircumstances, homeless individuals likely would own. In this case, it was the iPhone 8 frame. Furthermore, in an effort to gradually diminish the problem completely, I made sure to incorporate features that catered to all users, regardless of whether they had become homeless or not.\\n\\nLow Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nSketches from my crazy 8s and Straw Man proposal served as a foundation as I developed three app screens into low fidelity wireframes. The home screen, the support screen, and the profile screen formed made up the three screens. I chose to create the screens from the perspective of my user persona as I wanted to make sure that I addressed all the problems that I found during my research and that I kept the user at the forefront for all of my decisions. In order to add to the final screen layouts, I also made the decision to incorporate various elements from my brainstorming sketches into my designs.\\n\\nMid Fidelity Wireframes\\n\\nI modified my low fidelity wireframes into mid fidelity wireframes for the following step. During this phase, I made significant adjustments and added more text and icons to my designs, which enabled me to observe them more clearly and provide more depth. I changed the original placeholders for the profile, settings, search bar, map, and navigation bar on my first screen (the home screen) to match their corresponding icons. To improve accessibility and provide more clarification, I also made sure to add additional text to the navigation bar. In addition, I chose to add heart icons to represent the user\\'s ability to favourite their locations and additional arrow icons in place of the original wording \"slide for more\" to make it easier for users to identify and enable them to take action instinctively. Additionally, I learned that by doing this, I had more room to add more content.\\n\\nFollowing this, the process for my other two screens was essentially the same, with a few minor adjustments. I used the exact corresponding symbols that I had originally intended for my placeholders on my support screen, along with new icons like emojis that display the user\\'s daily mood, a donation and share icon, and additional text to reflect the amount donated and the number of supporters. The For You-Explore sidebar was an additional element I created; it was not on my original low-fidelity wireframe. During the design process, I aimed to distinguish between user-specific and non-specific support content-which users may pursue and contribute to their \"For You\" space.\\n\\nRegarding my profile screen, I used the appropriate icons next to the text to further demonstrate proficiency and allow for the overcoming of language hurdles; likewise, I intended for my settings feature to include language preferences for users, allowing them to navigate more freely. Furthermore, I included a calendar icon to assist users stay organised, schedule appropriately, and act as a reminder.\\n\\nHigh Fidelity Wireframes-\\n\\nI added my chosen colour palette to the high fidelity frames and swapped out all the placeholders with imagery that complimented my user persona. In addition to other colours, brown was a crucial component of my frames since I knew how important it was to make use of such colour to influence emotions onto my users as I wanted to ensure that they felt supported as they navigated the app and to know that they could always rely on it to meet their needs. In addition, I was able to prepare my designs for users at this stage by making them as realistic and vivid as possible.\\n\\nHicks Law- Hicks Law was a principle I applied to each of my designs. This is seen on the home page, where I utilise the GPS location scout capability to offer users resources that are in the vicinity for them to use. By reducing content that may possibly overwhelm users and making it simpler for them to select their preferred option, I have increased user engagement with the app. This is also visible on the support screen, where I offer recommendations based on the resources that are specific to them. By doing this, I have reduced cognitive load and made it easier for individuals to look into other resources for support in order to achieve their personal goals.\\n\\nAesthetic Usability Effect- This alludes to the users\\' perception that aesthetically pleasing designs are more functional and accessible at first glance, making minor usability concerns more bearable. In order to make my designs better suited to users\\' visual preferences, I used this law when creating the colour palette and imagery for my designs. Additionally, I made sure that the app\\'s purpose was still being pursued and that the primary function was still given priority.\\n\\nJacobs Law- This refers to the notion that users carry over their expectations from one familiar product to another, assuming identical functionality. To implement this law, I looked at the layout within the Our Calling app, which provided the user nearest facilities on their home page. I then replicated this layout for my own home page. My UI will be easier for users to locate exactly what they are searching for by being designed similarly to a direct competitor like Our Calling, optimising time efficiency and offering users a pleasant, easy-to-navigate experience.\\n\\nMiller\\'s Law- This law alludes to the \"magic number seven,\" which is the idea that the average person can retain about seven objects in working memory. It is known to be more beneficial to divide content into manageable chunks so that individuals can comprehend, absorb, and recall it quicker. Using my support screen, I implemented this law by dividing the support content into \"For You\" and \"Explore\" sections. In order to help users process the information more easily and without feeling overwhelmed, I also made sure that there was a limit of three assistance resources visible to them at any given moment within the personalised area of the screen.\\n\\nTypography\\n\\nI decided to utilise the Roboto typeface, which is part of the sans-serif family. This is because it is known to be a worldwide typeface with a straightforward style, allowing for a more natural reading experience. It is also recognized for functioning well with a variety of devices, sizes, and resolutions, which I make use of. I find it highly valuable because it can be seen on devices such as iOS or Androids, which are widely used today and are therefore more likely to be owned by a homeless person. In addition, I used the font styles for a variety of purposes, including highlighting essential information for the user. By switching between styles and using more kerning, I was able to build hierarchy where it was required in my designs.\\n\\nIt was essential to me to create my designs in accordance with the Equality Act of 2010, which encourages an equal society. It was my responsibility to make my designs more accessible for those with disabilities, as studies have revealed a significant increase in homeless people becoming disabled due to a lack of care. Furthermore, in order to adhere to the WCAG standards, I ensured that my text/font sizes were as perceivable as possible for users, allowing them not to be misread and robust enough to be deciphered by the most commonly used assistance technology such as screen readers/magnifiers. Moreover, I used the figma mirror plugin to guarantee that my icons were large enough for users to tap and did not pose any usability concerns.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOverall, I believe that this case study was a success, allowing me to uncover and learn so much. I was able to successfully follow the double diamond process and create designs to solve my initial problem statement. Through the research, I was able to determine what was a priority for homeless individuals and proceed to concentrate on building fitting screens to assist combat this. However, one surprising finding from my research was the lack of apps meant to combat homelessness and meet the needs of those who are homeless, despite the fact that the issue was at an all-time low during the pandemic due to the public\\'s goodwill in assisting those persons.\\n\\nFurthermore, it would have been more beneficial to have conducted primary research through questionnaires distributed to those who were or are currently homeless, a red route analysis to gather genuine data on what features would be essential to users, along with interviews with charities working to combat the issue. Moreover, I would have preferred to focus on creating my identity page rather than my profile page, which would have enabled users to identify other homeless people by submitting an image/location for members of neighbouring shelters to launch a search and rescue to assist them. I believe this was a fantastic feature that I introduced promptly in my mind map concept, although it would have been good if I had shown how it would have been visually built.\\n\\nLastly, if I had the ability to launch this project, I would have worked jointly with the NHS to provide an outreach service specifically tailored to the primary care of homeless individuals, made up of nurses, therapists, and volunteers.\\n\\nThe Connection at St Martin\\'s.

       "    'body': \"This essay examines the importance of technology in our modern society, illuminating the growing influence of technological progress on a range of facets of human existence. Today the world is going through a rapid change. Globalizations made possible revolutionary changes or development in information and communications technology. In modern age, we can't think to live without information and technology. Today, computers are considered one of the important things a erson / establishment can utilize. Many people have begun to depend on resources like information and technology to get things properly working on their behalf. The process of sharing the data has become a lot easier., despite the physical distance that may possibly be in between or for those wh Ino are not familiar with the function of the business that are involved in the information technology sector. Information and technology is actually an area where innovations are managed. Technology is making the multifunctional functions to be available in a single device. Thus, we can have multifunctional usage of the single device we own. The simpler the work gets with and the more we get dependent on it. Technology makes us lethargic with little or no physical activity, in one aspect; but the same and provides a creative jobs including physical activity.\\n\\nTechnology makes us dependent on it, hence, technology plays a major role in our lives. Information and technology has a great significance in the field of communication, inventory management, data management, management informative system, education, health sector, agriculture and banking sector, etc.\\n\\nInformation and Technology plays a crucial role in every sphere of life. Modern Information and Technology has become so entrenched in the idea of a modern society that both are closely intertwined with each other. . Developing countries try to get better utilities, more vehicles, faster computers as well as internet and cell phone providers because that's what makes a society modern. Technologies are tools and techniques that support and development of information system. It is important in areas as:\\n\\nHEALTH SECTOR:In the health sector, technology advanced to a great extent that today a machine car assists a person in intensive care and monitor him, which was a tiresome and risky job to do manually before. Automation of processes has brought about efficiency and speed. Speedy performance of tasks has saved human effort and time. With information and technology devices available even in remote villages, there is a potential that technologies could revolutionized health service delivery and acts as a game changer for an effective and people centered healthcare system in the 21st century.\\n\\nEDUCATION:Information and technology play a major role in the modern education. Some are promoted to do inventions. Many wonders of Information and technology such as Radio, television etc. is helpful for the students. Gone are the days of slates and chalks. Teaching through computers will be more effective. In the western world, we see that they have already switched over to this new way of teaching and learning. The computer is not an alternative of teaching but it is an able helper of the teachers. Teachers can teach better through the computer because it an audio-visual means of information.\\n\\nInformation and Communication Technology helps in other areas of modern society such as: communication, data management, inventory management, consumer relationship management, etc.\\n\\nCommunication: for many companies, e-mail is the main means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. E-mail was one of the early drivers of the internet providing a simple and inexpensive means to communicate. Over the years, a number of other communication tools have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat system online meeting tools and video conferencing.\\n\\nData Management:The days of large file rooms, rows of filing cabinets and the mailing of documents is fading fast. Today, most companies store digital versions of documents on servers and storage devices. These documents become instantly available to everyone in the company regardless of their geographical location. Companies are able to store and maintain a tremendous amount of historical data economically and employees benefit from immediate access to the documents they need.\\n\\nInventory Management: These systems are best used when the inventory management system is connected to the point of sale (POS) system. The POS system ensures that each time ,an item is sold, one of those items is removed from the inventory count, creating a closed information loop between all departments.\",\n",

       "    'title': 'The connection between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies',\n",
       "    'body': 'As I begin this research journey, I am drawn to the interesting link between supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. Studying this complicated link is a journey to solve the mysteries of our universe and discover our place within it. Understanding the interaction between SMBHs and their host galaxies is important beyond the domains of astrophysics; it has significant significance for our society as a whole. Understanding the complicated interaction between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is important for reasons that go far beyond pure scientific investigation. A supermassive black hole is a point in the center of a galaxy that is extremely massive and dense. The enormous collections of stars, gas, dust, and other materials known as galaxies are now held together by gravity. This strong relationship between galaxies and supermassive black holes exists. It resembles an alliance with a difference. The black hole acts as a powerful cosmic vacuum cleaner, drawing objects closer with the force of its strong gravity. Additionally, as the material is drawn in, it heats up and emits energy, including light and X-rays. What is a black hole? Composition and formation: A black hole is an area of space where gravity is so powerful that nothing can escape from it, not even light. This uncommon phenomenon results from large objects collapsing entirely due to their gravitational pull. The enigmatic celestial phenomenon known as a black hole is frequently described as having a \"singularity\" at its center in terms of composition. This singularity is a region of infinite density where the fundamental principles of physics no longer remain accurate. Essentially, it is an area of spacetime where matter has been compressed to a size that is hard to fully understand. They have an event horizon around the singularity. It is a line where nothing can escape due to the strong gravitational force. Due to the absence of any observable radiation from their surface, black holes have a unique look of being \"black\" due to their event horizon. The formation of a black hole can result from numerous processes, each linked to the collision of enormous objects. They come in three main categories. The first category is the stellar-mass black hole. They are created from the remains of large stars that collapsed after running out of nuclear fuel. A big star\\'s center collapses under its gravity when the pressure from nuclear fusion inside it is no longer able to support it. If the collapsing core\\'s mass is substantial, it will continue to fall after the neutron star develops, and eventually collapse into a black hole. The second category is intermediate-mass black holes. There are a variety of ways that these black holes are formed, for example, by the direct collapse of immense gas clouds in the early universe or the merger and collision of smaller black holes. Their exact formation mechanisms are still being researched and understood. The last category of black holes is supermassive black holes. The most massive form of black holes, with masses ranging from millions to billions of times that of the Sun, can be found at the centers of most galaxies. Research regarding the exact process of their development is still going on, but one accepted theory proposes that over cosmic periods, mass is gradually accumulated by the absorption of surrounding gas and mergers with other black holes and stars. Understanding their relationship To better understand this, we will look at how their relationship developed over time, galaxy types, and environments, and interacted with dark matter halos (which are collections of dark matter particles, a hypothesized material that doesn\\'t interact with ordinary matter but composes most of the galaxy). Here are a few essential points to keep in mind throughout the evolution of black hole-galaxy connections. These findings provide fascinating insights into the early development of black hole-galaxy connections. Some scaling correlations appear to remain at high redshifts, implying that the links between black hole mass and galaxy features were determined shortly after galaxy formation. However, major variations are discovered, implying that the interaction between black holes and galaxies may have changed in the distant past. The presence of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity can be deduced from spectral patterns in high-redshift galaxies, suggesting that black holes were affecting their host galaxies even in the early cosmos. AGN activity has been seen to have feedback effects on the surrounding gas, which may influence star formation. What is AGN? AGN describes a small area near the galactic center that radiates a disproportionately large quantity of energy in the radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X, and gamma-ray bands. Some of the universe\\'s brightest and most energetic objects are AGNs. The accretion of material onto a supermassive black hole at the galaxy\\'s nucleus is thought to be what drives AGNs\\' energy production. An accretion disk is created as matter enters the black hole, producing intense radiation and occasionally strong outflows of particles and energy. Galaxies have a variety of shapes, ranging from spirals to ellipticals. They live in a variety of cosmic contexts, ranging from isolated regions to groupings of galaxies. Understanding how various galaxy types and surroundings affect black hole-galaxy interactions is a step toward understanding cosmic history. Different galaxy shapes may indicate different histories of star formation and fusion events. This can have an impact on the growth of central black holes. Spirals with active star formation may have other black hole-galaxy connections than early-type galaxies with restrained star formation. What is Dark matter? Dark matter is a form that is hypothesized to account for a considerable amount of the universe\\'s mass, even though it does not © 2022 The Authors 2 Diana Elenes emit light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation that we could directly monitor. It was first suggested to clarify the differences between observed gravitational effects in the cosmos and the amount of visible matter that we can detect. Dark matter halos supply the gravitational basis that helps galaxies develop. Understanding how these halos interact with galaxies and their center black holes is very important to understanding the fundamental interactions that drive their co-evolution. The mass of a dark matter halo affects where galaxies and black holes live. The relationship between halo mass and black hole mass gives information on how the gravitational pull of the halo influences the available gas supply for both star formation and black hole accretion. The history of dark matter Halo formation impacts the conditions in which galaxies and black holes form. Late-stage halo mergers may stimulate star formation and black hole accretion, changing the rates of growth of both components. Conversely, the inactive construction of halos may result in restricted growth. Discoveries that have shaped our understanding The relationship between SMBH mass and galaxy properties like star velocity dispersion in the galactic bulge suggests a shared history of growth and change. Their shared trajectory suggests that the origin and evolution of SMBHs and galaxies are closely intertwined. When galaxies evolve, their central SMBHs increase in lockstep, revealing a bond formed in the early phases of cosmic evolution. It also emphasizes the mutual influence that SMBHs and galaxies have on each other\\'s evolution. As SMBHs gain mass and emit energy in the form of radiation, the surrounding universe is affected. The energetic output of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can heat or eject gas, influencing the galaxy\\'s rate and dynamics of star formation. On the other hand, the galaxy\\'s dynamics might determine the availability of gas and dust, which eventually fuel SMBH absorption. Interactions like mergers can direct material into the SMBH, resulting in higher accretion and greater AGN activity. This vicious circle creates an interplay in which the SMBH\\'s expansion affects the evolution of the galaxy and vice versa. As we learn more about this link, we gain insight into the mechanisms that drive galaxy collisions, activate AGNs, and regulate star formation. Understanding these processes not only improves our understanding of the universe\\'s past but also provides hints about its future. We get significant insights into the complicated development of the universe by understanding how galaxies and their central SMBHs co-evolve. Ways of AGN Outflows and SMBHGalaxy Co-evolution: 1. Outflow Generation Mechanisms: AGN outflows can be caused by several factors, including radiation pressure, magneto-hydrodynamic processes, and accretion disk winds. These systems generate outflows with significant kinetic energy capable of impacting the ISM on galactic scales. 2. AGN outflows play an essential role in controlling excessive SMBH growth by eliminating excessive gas from the accumulation disk\\'s vicinity. This process controls the mass accretion rate onto the SMBH, balancing accretion and outflow and preventing the SMBH from limiting its expansion 3. Effects on Star Formation: AGN outflows can pass through the interstellar medium, compressing and heating it. Depending on the timing of the interaction, this compression can either prevent or encourage star formation. AGN-driven outflows may either suppress star development by evacuating gas from star-forming regions or they may initiate star formation in compressed gas regions. In conclusion, the discovery of intense AGN-driven outflows has given us context for the interaction that exists between SMBHs and galaxies. These outflows serve as feedback processes, changing galaxy morphology and influencing star formation rates. The research emphasizes the importance of more observational studies and theoretical advances to get a thorough knowledge of the interactions between AGN outflows, SMBHs, and galaxy evolution. . We are getting closer to comprehending the complexity of the cosmic cycle that connects these two essential components. The quenching of star formation. There are multiple ways, such as 1. The suppression of star formation caused by AGN feedback is one of the most fascinating features of the interaction between SMBHs and galaxies. This phenomenon is a critical link between the evolution of SMBHs and the evolution of galaxies, emphasizing the complex and symbiotic interaction that exists between these cosmic entities. 2. Observational: A few observational studies have provided compelling evidence for the quenching effect of AGN feedback on star formation. 3. Morphological Quenching: Certain galaxies have specific morphological traits, like massive protuberances or elliptical forms, that are frequently associated with inactive, non-star-forming systems. The expulsion of gas by AGN outflows can cause diskdominated galaxies to convert into spheroidal, quenched systems. 4. Radio Mode AGNs: Radio-loud AGNs, which emit intense radio emissions, are typically found in elliptical galaxies with little star production. The energy released via radio emissions is thought to be a major contributor to AGN feedback and quenching in these systems. As we have pretty good knowledge about the quenching effect of AGN feedback, we still have some questions, for example, 1. How do the durations of AGN flow impact star formation and relate to AGN activity lifetimes? 2. How does AGN variability add to the cyclic structure of star formation cooling? 3. How does a galaxy\\'s environment impact the relationship between AGN feedback and star formation? 4. Do galaxies in diverse positions have different quenching mechanisms? In a few words, the reduction of star formation by AGN feedback is a powerful demonstration of the precise interplay between supermassive black holes and galaxies. The ability to produce new stars is greatly limited as AGNs remove heat gas from a galaxy\\'s center regions. This quenching effect affects not just individual galaxies but also the galaxy population as a whole and the evolution of structures across cosmic time. Continued research into this phenomenon has the potential to reveal the essential mechanisms that drive the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies, shedding light on the fundamental processes that build the intricate weave of our universe. The Influence of AGN Feedback on Galaxy-SMBH Co-Evolution 1. The Independence Theory, which holds that the expansion of SMBHs at the centers of galaxies and the development of their host galaxies are mostly independent processes, was contested by Philip F. Hopkins in 2006. This theory, which proposed that SMBHs and galaxies form independently and with little to no reciprocal interaction, was widely accepted in the area of astrophysics. Hopkins\\' research used hydrodynamic models to investigate the effect of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback on star formation rates in galaxies, offering a novel viewpoint. The energy and matter released during the accretion of material onto a core SMBH are referred to as AGN feedback. This feedback may manifest as radiation, jets, or outflows that modify the interstellar medium in the vicinity. Further investigation into the mechanics of AGN feedback and its function in galaxy development has been sparked by this new perspective, which has caused a change in our understanding of how galaxies and their central black holes evolve over cosmic time. The study proposed that AGN feedback functions as a regulatory mechanism that influences the formation of galaxies. AGN feedback may potentially stop or slow down the formation of a galaxy\\'s central bulge, affecting the galaxy\\'s general evolution, by ejecting gas from the center regions. Feedback Loop: The data suggested a feedback loop involving the galaxy and the SMBH. The galaxy\\'s gas reservoir and the interstellar medium are both impacted by the SMBH\\'s accretion of matter and energy, which in turn alters the circumstances for star formation. 2. Tiziana Di Matteo carried out ground-breaking computer simulations in 2005 that shed light on how Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) feedback affects galaxy evolution. Her studies showed how AGN feedback can cause galaxies to release large amounts of gas into space, suppressing star formation and changing galaxy shapes. The prevailing wisdom that the expansion of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxy evolution are separate processes was contested by this study. Principal Results of Di Matteo\\'s Research Outflows Caused by AGN Activity: Di Matteo\\'s simulations showed that outflows of gas from galaxies can be strongly influenced by the energy released by AGN activity. These outflows effectively stop or quench star formation in the afflicted regions by carrying a sizable amount of gas and energy away from the galactic core. Star Formation Suppression: The study showed that star formation rates are directly affected by AGN feedback-induced outflows. AGN feedback can make it difficult for young stars to form by ejecting gas and causing disruptions in the interstellar medium. Co-evolutionary Evidence from Observation 1. SMBHs and their host galaxies were the subject of a large study carried out in 2002 by Paul T. P. Ho and C. Megan Urry. They found empirical support for a high correlation between the mass of SMBHs and particular characteristics of their host galaxies. This link highlighted how the development of SMBHs and their galactic hosts is interdependent. Important Results: The study by Woo and Urry, \"SMBH Mass and Host Galaxy Features,\" found a connection between the mass of the central SMBH and a few observable host galaxy characteristics, such as the velocity dispersion of stars in the bulge and the luminosity of the galaxy\\'s core. This correlation showed a basic connection between the galaxy\\'s characteristics and the black hole\\'s development. Galaxy-Black Hole Co-Evolution: The observed link suggested that SMBHs and galaxies have undergone co-evolution. SMBHs appear to have an impact on the dynamics and evolution of their host galaxies as they expand through accretion processes. Connection to Galactic Bulges: The relationship between velocity dispersion in the bulge and SMBH growth suggests that the development and evolution of galactic bulges may be related. The coincidence raised the possibility that the same forces responsible for SMBH growth could also be at work in the galactic nucleus. Galaxy Evolution Models: Woo and Urry\\'s findings challenged previous ideas that black hole and galaxy evolution occurred independently. New models that take into account the feedback and interactions between these two components are being considered in light of the empirical relationship between SMBH mass and galaxy characteristics. Black Hole Growth Mechanisms: The study indicated that the presence of gas reservoirs within galaxies is related to SMBH growth. The processes influencing galactic evolution appeared to be connected with the mechanisms that control gas availability and initiate AGN activity. Woo and Urry\\'s study gave us a quantitative foundation for understanding the interaction between these two essential elements of galactic systems by establishing a quantifiable relationship between SMBH mass and observable host galaxy properties. The complicated and intricate character of the interactions between galaxies was underlined by this empirical relationship, which also brought up significant issues regarding the processes underlying their co-evolution. 2. Using data from the Galaxy Zoo project, Kevin Schawinski carried out a study in 2009 to look at the connections between AGNs, galaxy morphologies, and interactions. His work provided insight into the relationship between AGN activity, galaxy disruption, and the feedback mechanisms that affect both the host galaxy and the SMBH at its center. Important Results: The influence of the AGN feedback on galaxy disruption processes was suggested by the study\\'s findings. AGN feedback, which involves the ejection of matter and energy from the central SMBH, may have an impact on the dynamical development and morphology of the galaxy. Mutual Influence: The results provided evidence for the interaction between galaxies and AGNs. Both the SMBH and the host galaxy may be affected, changing their physical and morphological properties as a result of interaction-driven AGN fueling and subsequent feedback processes. Galaxy Evolution: According to Schawinski\\'s research, AGNs may influence galaxy evolution through interactions, mergers, and feedback. Observational proof of the dynamic interaction between SMBHs and galaxies was supplied by the relationship between AGN activity and disturbed galaxy morphologies. Linked Histories and Feedback Mechanisms: In 2012, Andrew C. Fabian conducted a study that focused on the significant role of AGN outflows in shaping the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and influencing star formation processes. His research highlighted the intricate feedback loop between AGN activity, SMBH expansion, and the availability of gas for star formation. Important Results: Positive and Negative Feedback: The ISM may be affected positively or negatively by AGN feedback processes. When some parts of the gas are compressed by AGN-driven outflows, fresh star formation is stimulated. When AGN outflows evacuate gas and prevent star formation, negative feedback ensues. The enormous and intricate mixture of gas, dust, and other stuff that fills the space between stars in a galaxy is known as the interstellar medium (ISM). It provides the raw materials for star formation, fills the spaces between stars, and creates the conditions for a variety of astrophysical activities. Galaxy evolution is regulated by the feedback relationship between AGN activity, gas ejection, and star formation. It implies that the development of host galaxies and the growth of SMBHs are interdependent processes, where the energy generated by AGNs can impact the evolution of the galaxy\\'s ISM and shape the formation of the SMBH. The ISM plays an important role for a variety of reasons: The ISM offers the required building blocks for the creation of new stars. Molecular clouds can contain dense regions that can collapse under the force of their gravity, creating protostars and eventually new stars. Astrophysical Processes: : The ISM is the site of numerous significant astrophysical processes, including cosmic ray propagation, magnetic field interactions, and shockwaves from supernova explosions. Galactic evolution is governed by feedback systems, which include the ISM. Star formation and other phenomena can be affected by processes like stellar winds, supernova explosions, and the activity of active galactic nuclei, which can return energy and matter to the ISM. Feedback Loop Mechanism: A feedback loop is produced by the AGN feedback\\'s outflows. The amount of gas available for star formation is impacted by the AGN\\'s gas emission. This in turn affects the galaxy\\'s star formation\\'s speed and effectiveness. The study hypothesized that AGN outflows might reduce the gas supply in the center parts of galaxies, which would quench star formation. The amount of gas that is available to create new stars may be reduced as a result of this depletion, thus quenching or suppressing star formation. 2. As distinct phases of AGN feedback, King (2005) proposed the \"quasar mode\" and \"radio mode.\" Quasar mode is defined by radiation pressure-driven outflows that impact star formation, whereas radio mode is characterized by jet-driven feedback that expels gas, therefore avoiding star formation. Furthermore, the discoveries of AGN-driven feedback have changed how we think about galaxySMBH co-evolution. This literature review highlights the shift from the idea of an isolated galaxy and the evolution of the SMBH through an examination of theoretical models, research, and observational evidence. Instead, the dynamic feedback processes and shared histories that tie together the growth paths of SMBHs and galaxies are emphasized by these studies. Research in this area is expected to advance and eventually, reveal more about this complex interplay. Association between SMBH Mass and Host Galaxy Properties: It was found a surprising association between the mass of the core SMBH and the characteristics of the host galaxy\\'s bulge through research of a broad sample of galaxies. Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, succeeded in verifying this link and discovering a statistically significant correlation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.76 and a p-value of 0.001. The co-evolutionary theory, according to which the expansion of the SMBH and the bulge of the galaxy are connected, is supported by this correlation. The feedback processes by which SMBHs affect their host galaxies It was discovered by analyzing radio observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and X-ray data from Chandra. These outflows add energy to the interstellar medium in the area, possibly controlling star formation. These outflows\\' spectrum examination revealed velocities of up to 0.1 c, highlighting their potential influence on the galactic environment. Consequences for Galaxy Evolution Models: Our findings have significant consequences for galaxy evolution models. The relationship between SMBH mass and galaxy bulge characteristics provides support to the idea that both parts have a similar growth mechanism, which may be influenced by merger and accretion events. The discovered feedback mechanisms highlight the function of SMBHs in controlling star formation and preserving the harmony of galactic ecosystems. Joint Growth Process: The relationship between galactic bulge properties and supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass points to a shared growth process for these two elements. According to this association, mergers and accretion events may be responsible for both the SMBH and the central bulge of a galaxy\\'s history. The SMBH and the surrounding bulge can both gain mass as a result of these occurrences. The interconnection of the mechanisms influencing galaxy structure is highlighted by this cooperative growth mechanism, which casts doubt on earlier theories that these two components form independently. Evolution Driven by Mergers: It is well known that the evolution of galaxies is greatly influenced by mergers between them. The relationship found between SMBH mass and galaxy bulge properties supports the idea that galaxy mergers are a primary factor in the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies. The center SMBHs of the progenitor galaxies mix as well as galaxies combine, possibly causing the resulting SMBH to develop rapidly and triggering feedback processes. The SMBH\\'s expansion as well as the star formation in the bulge may be fueled by these mergers, which might also set off powerful accretion events.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Researchers, maybe it\\'s time we reshuffle the cards.\\n\\nI was reading User Interviews\\'s State of UXR 2024 Report just now and I\\'m trying to wrap my head around some of the stuff there.\\n\\nAccording to the study, slowly but steadily, user research is more valued across the board.\\n\\nApparently, buy-in starts to be less of a problem, there\\'s more awareness of the importance of conducting research and there seems to be more interest in insights. Research finally started \"talking the language of the business\" (rolling my eyes as I write this).\\n\\nLet alone those companies that still don\\'t have a researcher and are still not even considering the possibility. These are not featured in the report and it\\'s where a lot of potential future researcher jobs lie.\\n\\nOn top of that, researchers seem to now allocate more and more of their time to giving support to other roles, whether through teaching, training or working on the infrastructure. Slightly moving towards an enablement or empowerment function. Probably as a response to being outnumbered, maybe as a consequence of leadership decisions or simply to adapt to a new reality.\\n\\nThis last bit is a consequence of the rising popularity of Product Discovery and Democratization. More and more companies are trying these things out and the number of PWDR (People Who Do Research) is increasing, as well as the ratio PWDR to Researchers (more than doubled in two years!), naturally. As I said in this 2023 talk, research is getting messy.\\n\\nIn a nutshell: it seems companies want more insights but do not necessarily want to invest in researchers, who are, in turn, asked to empower other roles in insight collection tasks. More research happening, less researchers.\\n\\nThe current situation is inviting us (or should I say forcing us?) to rethink how we position ourselves and what role we should play in the team.\\n\\nNow comes the opinion part.\\n\\nFor me, it\\'s all about the value researchers bring to a company and how it\\'s perceived.\\n\\nFor quite some time, we researchers focused on the collection of data. We gathered insights, we brought the customer\\'s voice into the organization. We went, did the research, came back and delivered the results.\\n\\nSecond, if the value we propose to an org resides only in the collection of data, not only we\\'re exposing ourselves to be replaced but also we\\'re not exploiting our potential to the max. We\\'re leaving so much on the table.\\n\\nWhen money is tight, a quick workaround seems to be reducing the number of researchers (or cutting them out altogether) and having the collection done by other roles. Even if the quality is not the same.\\n\\n\"Why have researchers do research when it can be done by designers or PMs?\" some leaders might think.\\n\\nWhen the number of researchers in a company is low, we are asked to do more with less and we need to be smart about where to strike to make the most impact.\\n\\nSome might argue that the most impact can be achieved by moving \"upwards\" in the range of research that we do, and if we\\'re allowed to work on more strategic projects, our impact will be seen. And that\\'s fair, that\\'s one way to look at it. However, for me, that\\'d still be pairing our value with the data collection.\\n\\nThe move towards more ReOps tasks makes sense. Research doesn\\'t happen magically and you need to have the right infrastructure to make it happen. Plus, you also want to ensure a certain standard. Having said that, I believe it doesn\\'t end there.\\n\\nI believe researchers can help organizations learn more and better by empowering other teams, then connect all that knowledge that\\'s produced and by having this nurtured 360-view, inform decisions at different levels.\\n\\nI\\'m a football fan (you now get all the Messi references in my content?) so I like to use the term playmaker. I see researchers as someone who drives the ball, connects plays, involves the rest of the team and helps elevate everybody\\'s game to score goals and win.\\n\\nMy hunch is that if we\\'re successful at positioning ourselves this way, not only we can use our skills and knowledge to a much larger extent but also we can have an enhanced impact in different levels of an organization.\\n\\nMy goal is to have research as a staple position in most companies and I believe this can be one way of doing that.',\n",

       "    'title': 'The Evolution of Broadcast Playout Systems',\n",
       "    'body': 'The broadcast industry has witnessed a remarkable transformation over the past four decades, particularly in the realm of playout systems. This evolution reflects not only technological advancements but also fundamental shifts in content creation, distribution, and consumption. Let\\'s explore this journey in detail, from the hardware-intensive operations of the 1980s to today\\'s sophisticated cloud-based solutions, with a special focus on the innovative companies driving this change.\\n\\nThe Early Days: 1980s to 1990s\\n\\nIn the 1980s, broadcast playout was characterized by its heavy reliance on physical media and manual processes. The industry was dominated by videotape formats such as 1-inch Type C, U-matic, and Betacam SP for program playback. Technicians played a crucial role in the playout process, manually loading tapes into players with meticulous timing and coordination. While early automation systems began to emerge during this period, they were rudimentary compared to today\\'s standards. The equipment of the era demanded regular maintenance and calibration to maintain broadcast quality, making the entire process labor-intensive and requiring a high level of technical expertise. This era laid the foundation for the significant technological advancements that would transform broadcast playout in the decades to come.\\n\\nThe 1990s heralded the beginning of the digital transition in broadcast playout, marking a significant shift from the analog-dominated landscape of the previous decade. This era saw the introduction of digital video servers, which began to replace traditional tape machines, revolutionizing content storage and retrieval processes. Alongside this hardware evolution, more sophisticated automation software emerged, substantially reducing the need for manual intervention in playout operations. Additionally, broadcasters began implementing basic digital asset management systems to organize and manage their rapidly growing digital libraries. These technological advancements laid the groundwork for the more complex and efficient playout systems that would develop in the following years, setting the stage for the digital-first approach that would come to define modern broadcasting.\\n\\nThe 2000s: The Rise of Integrated Playout Systems\\n\\nThe new millennium brought significant advancements in playout technology:\\n\\nThe dawn of the new millennium ushered in a period of significant technological advancements in broadcast playout systems, with PlayBox Technology emerging as a pioneer in this evolving landscape. The company\\'s flagship Channel-in-a-Box (CiAB) solutions represented a paradigm shift in how broadcasters approached playout operations.\\n\\nThese innovative CiAB systems integrated multiple functions into a single, compact hardware unit, revolutionizing the traditional playout setup. The all-in-one solution encompassed video playback, graphics and branding capabilities, audio processing, and closed captioning functionality. This consolidation of features marked a departure from the previous era\\'s reliance on multiple discrete devices for each function.\\n\\nThe impact of CiAB solutions on broadcast operations was multifaceted. Firstly, they dramatically reduced the physical space requirements in control rooms and broadcast facilities. Where once racks of equipment were necessary, a single CiAB unit could now handle the same tasks, leading to more efficient use of studio space.\\n\\nReliability was another key advantage of these integrated systems. By reducing the number of separate components and potential points of failure, CiAB solutions improved overall system stability. This increased reliability was crucial for broadcasters, as it minimized the risk of on-air technical issues and reduced downtime.\\n\\nPerhaps most significantly, CiAB solutions offered a cost-effective option for smaller broadcasters and niche channels. The all-in-one nature of these systems meant lower initial investment costs, reduced maintenance expenses, and simplified operations. This democratization of playout technology allowed smaller players in the broadcast industry to access professional-grade solutions that were previously out of reach due to budget constraints.\\n\\nPlayBox Technology\\'s CiAB solutions also offered scalability and flexibility. Broadcasters could start with a basic setup and gradually add features or expand their capabilities as needs grew or budgets allowed. This scalability made CiAB solutions attractive not only to small broadcasters but also to larger organizations looking to launch new channels or services efficiently.\\n\\nThe introduction of CiAB solutions also had implications for workflow efficiency. By integrating multiple functions into a single interface, these systems streamlined operations and reduced the learning curve for technical staff. This integration facilitated more agile and responsive broadcast operations, allowing for quicker changes to programming and more dynamic content delivery.\\n\\nAs the decade progressed, PlayBox Technology continued to refine and expand its CiAB offerings, incorporating emerging technologies and responding to evolving industry needs. The success of their solutions not only transformed broadcast playout but also inspired other manufacturers to develop similar integrated systems, further driving innovation in the field.\\n\\nTo keep pace with evolving industry trends and technological advancements, PlayBox Technology developed in the late 2010s its innovative AirBox Mega ICX solution.

This adaptability allowed organizations of various sizes and complexities to tailor the system to their unique operational demands, ensuring that the AirBox Mega ICX platform could serve a wide range of broadcast environments while remaining future-proof in the face of ongoing technological evolution.\\n\\nThe 2010s: Transition to Software-Defined Playout\\n\\nThe broadcast industry experienced a significant paradigm shift as it moved towards software-defined solutions for playout operations. This transformation was characterized by the virtualization of playout functions, which markedly reduced the industry\\'s reliance on proprietary hardware. Concurrently, the adoption of IP-based workflows revolutionized playout architectures, introducing unprecedented levels of flexibility and scalability. These advancements allowed broadcasters to adapt more readily to changing demands and technological innovations. In response to these developments, many broadcasters embraced hybrid models that strategically combined on-premises equipment with cloud-based services. This approach provided a balance between the control and security of traditional infrastructure and the agility and cost-effectiveness of cloud solutions, allowing broadcasters to leverage the best of both worlds while navigating the complex landscape of modern media delivery.\\n\\nGrass Valley\\'s Playout X represents a significant advancement in broadcast playout technology, built on the foundation of their Agile Media Processing Platform (AMPP). This innovative solution offers a flexible, scalable, and cloud-first approach to playout, catering to the evolving needs of modern broadcasters in an increasingly digital and on-demand media landscape.\\n\\nAt its core, Playout X leverages the power of cloud computing to provide a more agile and responsive playout system.

       "    'title': 'Designing User Experience on IPB Digitani Admin Website Application Using The Five Planes Method',\n",
       "    'body': 'Bogor Agricultural University in an effort to advance Indonesian agriculture in the digital era presents IPB Digitani among the people of Indonesia. The IPB Digitani application is supported by an administrator who helps the process of consultation activities as a form of information distribution. Information distribution is an important task of the administrator who will assign questions from farmers and agricultural extension workers to IPB experts who are relevant to the question. However, an in-depth analysis of the administrator\\'s needs has not been conducted. Therefore, deeper research is needed to design and test improvements to the IPB Digitani application administrator web prototype based on user needs. This research used The Five Planes method and collected retrospecitve think aloud, completion rate, time based efficiency, and misclicked data during testing. The test results were analyzed as a consideration in designing and identifying user needs. Comparison of existing and proposed design test results concluded that the proposed design can improve administrator productivity performance.\\n\\nKeywords: retrospective think aloud, the five planes, web administrator\\n\\n1.1 Background\\n\\nThe majority of productive farmers in Indonesia are over 40 years old, with 70% having only elementary education or less (Setyawan 2020). This lack of formal education has led to stagnation and even decline in Indonesia\\'s agricultural sector. Farmers often lack access to the latest innovations and knowledge needed to enhance agricultural productivity.\\n\\nTo address this, Bogor Agricultural University (IPB) launched IPB Digitani, a digital platform facilitating information exchange and solutions for agricultural issues among farmers, agricultural advisors, and IPB experts. Developed by IPB\\'s Institute for Information Management and Digital Transformation (LMITD) and managed by the Tani Center, this platform aims to accelerate agricultural advancement through technology (Barlian 2020).\\n\\nThe IPB Digitani application includes a web administrator to manage its features, particularly consultations between farmers and IPB experts. Farmers need dynamic information about new technologies and two-way communication with experts to address agricultural problems (Panda et al. 2019).\\n\\nPrevious research on web admin design in the agricultural sector focused on information media and marketing, such as the web admin application for farmers in Nagari Alahan Panjang, Solok Regency (Meidina et al. 2020). However, these applications lack consultation features between farmers and agricultural experts.\\n\\nPoor admin experience leads to errors in managing IPB Digitani\\'s features, especially in distributing farmers\\' requests to IPB experts. Problems reported by IPB Digitani admins include a cluttered dashboard, non-intuitive call-to-action buttons, a cumbersome user admission feature, and suboptimal request tracking. The admin website fails to meet fundamental user experience aspects essential for product success.\\n\\nThis study aims to redesign and enhance the user experience of the IPB Digitani admin website using The Five Planes methodology, with usability evaluation through the Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA) method, measuring completion rate, time-based efficiency, and misclicks to identify admin needs and improve user experience.\\n\\n1.2 Problem Statement\\n\\nThe research aims to evaluate the IPB Digitani admin website and enhance admin productivity by designing a user experience that addresses the primary needs and issues of IPB Digitani admins, providing improvement recommendations through a comparative evaluation of the existing and proposed design prototypes.\\n\\n1.3 Objectives\\n\\nThe objectives of this study are to identify the needs of the Tani Center as the web administrator in facilitating consultations between farmers, advisors, and IPB experts, and to design and test an improved admin web prototype to enhance the Tani Center\\'s user experience.\\n\\n1.4 Benefits\\n\\nThis research aims to improve the features of the IPB Digitani admin website, aligning them with user needs, thereby facilitating the Tani Center\\'s role in managing consultations and information distribution between farmers, advisors, and IPB experts.\\n\\nIPB Digitani is a technological advancement in agriculture, designed to connect IPB experts with farmers via a website and mobile app. It shares agricultural knowledge developed at IPB. This application, developed from a research roadmap (2016-2020) by the SEIS Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, FMIPA IPB (Setyatama 2016), is managed by LMITD and Tani Center at IPB (Barlian 2020). It includes a web administrator for overseeing all activities.\\n\\n2.2 Five Planes Method\\n\\nThis study uses Garrett\\'s (2011) Five Planes method for user experience design, which involves five interlinked phases: (1) strategy, (2) scope, (3) structure, (4) skeleton, and (5) surface. These phases build sequentially from abstract to concrete, affecting each subsequent phase (Maggenta et al. 2022).\\n\\n2.3 Retrospective Think Aloud\\n\\nRetrospective think aloud is a usability testing method where users verbalize their thoughts after completing tasks. This method, identified by Nielsen (2012) and Ericsson and Simon (1993), involves recording user activities for detailed analysis (Nielsen 1993).\\n\\n3.1 Research Data\\n\\nThis study employs quantitative performance measurement data from respondents completing task scenarios. The data is collected from two Tani Center web administrators. Performance measurement assesses the variables of effectiveness and efficiency, following ISO 9241-11 (ISO 2018) guidelines. Effectiveness is defined as users\\' ability to achieve specific goals in a given context, while efficiency relates to the resources used relative to the accuracy and completeness of tasks performed by users.\\n\\nEffectiveness is measured by the success and failure rates of tasks completed by respondents. Success is assigned a binary value of \"1\" if the respondent completes the task and \"0\" if they fail. The effectiveness rate is calculated using the completion rate formula:\\n\\nEffectiveness is also evaluated through the analysis of error rates, specifically misclicks, which occur when users inadvertently click unintended elements. The misclicked percentage is calculated using the formula:\\n\\nEfficiency is measured by task time, which is the time required for participants to successfully complete tasks (Wahyuningrum 2021). Time-based efficiency is calculated using the ratio of task completion rate to the time taken to complete the task scenario. The formula for time-based efficiency is:\\n\\nWhere N is the total number of task scenarios, R is the number of users, nij is the success value of respondent j on task i (with a value of 1 for success and 0 for failure), and tij is the time taken by respondent j to complete task i.\\n\\nThis study utilizes The Five Planes and Retrospective Think Aloud (RTA) methods.\\n\\n3.2.1 Evaluating Existing Design\\n\\nUsability testing involves two web administrators of the IPB Digitani application. Before conducting RTA evaluation, task scenarios and interview questions are prepared. Participants provide feedback after task completion, and data on completion rate, time-based efficiency, and misclicks are collected (Tullis and Albert 2023).\\n\\n3.2.2 Strategy Plane\\n\\nThis stage analyzes user needs and product development goals to create a balance. User personas are developed based on test data (Garrett 2011).\\n\\n3.2.3 Structure Plane\\n\\nThis stage involves creating information architecture and user interaction design through user flows (Garrett 2011).\\n\\n3.2.4 Skeleton Plane\\n\\nA low-fidelity prototype is designed, focusing on information, interface, and navigation design using Figma.\\n\\n3.2.5 Surface Plane\\n\\nA medium to high-fidelity prototype is developed, focusing on sensory design elements like visual aesthetics, typography, and consistency. Design guidelines are established using Figma.\\n\\n3.2.6 Evaluating Proposed Design\\n\\nThe high-fidelity prototype is evaluated using the same method as the existing design evaluation, focusing on task completion time and success rate with Maze prototype testing.\\n\\n3.2.7 Comparison\\n\\nQualitative and quantitative data from existing and proposed design evaluations are compared to determine if the new design meets user needs.\\n\\n3.2.8 Evaluation\\n\\nUsability inspection of both prototypes is conducted using the \"8 Golden Rules of Interface Design\" (Schneiderman 2016) and \"Heuristic Evaluation\" (Nielsen 1994). Recommendations are made for improving the Digitani admin website, and the revised prototype undergoes a final evaluation.\\n\\n4.1 Evaluation of Existing Design\\n\\nThe evaluation aims to identify administrator issues, understand consultation needs, and assess feature performance. The usability test plan dashboard facilitates organized and efficient usability testing (Nielsen 1994). This evaluation includes an analysis of effectiveness, efficiency, and RTA verbalization. Quantitative performance measurement and qualitative RTA analysis were conducted.\\n\\na. Effectiveness Analysis\\n\\nEffectiveness is measured by the average task completion rate of two respondents completing 14 task scenarios.\\n\\nTask Completion Rate Analysis\\n\\nEffectiveness also considers the misclicked percentage, indicating errors made during task completion.\\n\\nEfficiency is measured by time-based efficiency, assessing how quickly users complete tasks.\\n\\nRTA verbalization analysis categorizes responses into positive and negative to identify strengths and weaknesses of the interface. More negative feedback was received than positive.\\n\\nRTA Response Analysis\\n\\nIn this phase, user personas are designed to balance the product objectives and user needs, determining the product\\'s value proposition.\\n\\n4.2.1 Product Objective\\n\\nThe product objective is identified through direct interviews with IPB Digitani administrators. The aim is to enhance the IPB Digitani web administrator experience, making it a comprehensive agricultural solution connecting IPB agricultural experts with farmers.\\n\\n4.2.2 User Needs\\n\\nUser needs are identified through analysis of the existing design, including completion rate, time-based efficiency, misclicked data, and RTA verbalization analysis. The main issues identified include display difficulties, feature functionality, navigation, responsiveness, and content. User needs and corresponding content and feature solutions are summarized in Table 5.\\n\\nUser personas are specifically designed based on interview analysis with administrators. They present fictional characters synthesized from the analysis of user characteristics and criteria\\n\\nThe scope plane defines user scenarios and specifies the functionalities and content of the features to be designed for the IPB Digitani web administrator application.\\n\\n4.3.1 Functionalities and Content\\n\\nThe IPB Digitani web administrator must manage content (adding, editing, deleting) and handle user management and access rights. Key functionalities and content needs are detailed in Table 6.\\n\\nFunctional Needs and Specifications\\n\\nEffective content influences user decisions. The application provides useful content such as the latest question summaries, farmer lists, counselor lists, moderated and completed questions, and forum discussions with comments.\\n\\n4.3.2 User Scenario\\n\\nSarah uses the IPB Digitani web administrator to manage data and user activities. She prioritizes consultation and expert inquiry messages, moderates new questions, checks details, assigns relevant experts, and follows up on pending questions. Sarah ensures forum discussions adhere to rules and policies, and she verifies all farmer inquiries are addressed before leaving the application.\\n\\nIn the structure plane, user flows are designed for information architecture and interaction design using Procedure Task Analysis (PTA). The system development includes 22 task flows to optimize user productivity.\\n\\nIn the skeleton plane, a low-fidelity prototype is designed to layout and place interaction elements for the IPB Digitani web administrator system. This prototype includes lines, shapes, and text to provide a clear overview for the high-fidelity prototype.\\n\\nThe interface design simplifies user functionality by dividing content into four vertical navigation menus: dashboard, users, questions, and farmer forum. This layout, adopted from the existing design, aids user adaptation and productivity. The proposed design\\'s dashboard includes a notification feature to meet user needs defined in the strategy plane. Notifications for actions and new requests in each menu facilitate application management. The previous design lacked this feature, as revealed by user feedback during the existing design evaluation.\\n\\nIn the surface plane, a design guideline is created to guide the development of medium and high-fidelity prototypes for the IPB Digitani web administrator. This guideline includes visual elements such as color, typography, and icons. The progression from low-fidelity to medium and high-fidelity prototypes builds on the earlier designs. Interaction design in the high-fidelity prototype follows the task flows established in the structure plane, while layout design implements results from the skeleton plane. High-fidelity prototype development requires visual consistency, summarized in a style guide.\\n\\nInteraction design in the high-fidelity prototype follows the task flows established in the structure plane, while layout design implements results from the skeleton plane. High-fidelity prototype development requires visual consistency, summarized in a style guide. The design also incorporates several elements that support both functionality and aesthetics of the user interface, including buttons, icons, badges, images, and selector components.\\n\\nThe proposed design was evaluated using Maze, which provided heatmaps and misclick data. Task scenarios were more complex due to new features and menu adjustments. Usability testing focused on the grid layout, graphical content, and agricultural forum features. Users responded positively and showed optimal performance. The evaluation included 22 task scenarios to assess usability improvements. The results are summarized in the performance measurement and RTA analysis.\\n\\na. Effectiveness Analysis\\n\\nTask completion rate for the proposed design was 100% for both respondents across all 22 task scenarios.\\n\\nTask Completion Rate Analysis for Proposed Design\\n\\nb. Efficiency Analysis\\n\\nTime based efficiency analysis yielded an average score of 0.4471 goal/sec based on the completion of 22 task scenarios.\\n\\nTime Based Efficiency Analysis for Proposed Design\\n\\nc. Verbalization RTA Analysis\\n\\nRespondents provided both positive and negative feedback on the proposed design features. Positive feedback highlighted ease of navigation and intuitive layout, while negative feedback focused on the need for confirmation prompts and readability issues.\\n\\nVerbalization RTA Analysis for Proposed Design\\n\\nThe evaluation compared the existing and proposed designs using RTA and performance metrics across similar task scenarios. The proposed design showed significant enhancements in usability, such as improved moderation processes and clearer data presentation in tables and forums. Performance measurements indicated higher efficiency with a task completion rate of 100% and improved time-based efficiency (0.3733 goal/sec) compared to the existing design (0.1421 goal/sec). Minor issues like font size and label clarity were noted but overall, the proposed design demonstrated better usability and user satisfaction.\\n\\na. RTA Analysis Comparison between Existing and Proposed Design\\n\\nb. Performance Measurement Analysis Comparison\\n\\nThese evaluations underscored the effectiveness of design improvements in enhancing usability, efficiency, and user experience in the proposed application design.\\n\\nIn this phase, the existing and proposed design prototypes were evaluated against Ben Schneiderman\\'s \"8 Golden Rules of Interface Design\" and Nielsen\\'s Heuristic Evaluation principles. The evaluations aimed to assess usability and identify areas for improvement in both prototypes. Results of the \"8 Golden Rules of Interface Design\" review are summarized, while findings from the Heuristic Evaluation are presented separately.\\n\\nReview of Prototypes against \"8 Golden Rules of Interface Design\" Aspects\\n\\nReview of Prototypes against \"Heuristic Evaluation\" Aspects\\n\\na. Recommendations for Improvement\\n\\nRecommendations for improvement were derived from evaluations using the \"8 Golden Rules of Interface Design\" and \"Heuristic Evaluation\" methodologies.

       "    'body': \"A Guilde by ScaleUP USA | Federal Business Accelerator\\n\\nWelcome to the ScaleUP USA's Federal Business Accelerator podcast! I'm your host, and today we're diving into how Canadian companies can unlock lucrative opportunities with the US Federal Government.\\n\\nPlease like, subscribe, and comment below with your expertise and interest in working with the US Federal Government. Let's help each other succeed by teaming!\\n\\nDisclaimer:\\n\\nStay tuned until the end to gain a comprehensive understanding of the topic. For more information, visit www.scaleupus.com and explore the Federal Business Accelerator. Please note that federal government programs, personnel, budgets, and priorities change frequently. Always refer to official government websites for the most current information. This podcast and our online programs aim to inform you about the challenges, opportunities, problems, and solutions involved in building a US federal government practice. They are not intended to serve as legal or financial advice.\\n\\nThe US Federal Government: A Vast Marketplace:\\n\\nThe US federal government is the world's largest marketplace, with annual expenditures of over $9.3 trillion in FY 2023. In FY 2022, the federal government spent:\\n\\nAdditionally, the federal government is a major employer, providing jobs to over 10 million federal employees, contractors, and others as of 2023, making it a significant player in the global economy.\\n\\nThe Federal Problem:\\n\\nLess than 1% of the 33+ million businesses in the US are registered to do business with the federal government. There is no formal learning process in place to guide them through the complex process of visioning, strategizing, planning, implementing, and continuously improving their federal business growth and execution strategy. As a result, many businesses resort to trial and error, which often leads to failure.\\n\\nThe Canadian Economy and US Federal Opportunities:\\n\\nThe Canadian economy, while stable and growing, has limitations that can hinder the growth of companies. With a population of just over 37 million, the domestic market is relatively small, restricting the potential for scaling up. Additionally, the Canadian government's procurement budget is limited, offering fewer opportunities for companies to secure large contracts.\\n\\nIn contrast, the US federal government offers a vast and diverse market, with a procurement budget of over $9.3 trillion in 2023, providing unparalleled opportunities for growth. By working with the US federal government, Canadian companies can:\\n\\nFAR and DFAR Explained:\\n\\nThe Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) is a comprehensive set of rules governing all aspects of federal government procurement in the United States. It ensures that purchasing procedures are conducted in a fair, transparent, and consistent manner across all federal agencies. The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFAR) is an extension of FAR specifically tailored for the Department of Defense (DoD). DFAR includes additional regulatory requirements and policies that address the unique needs of defense-related acquisitions.\\n\\nCanadian Firms Working with the US Federal Government:\\n\\nCanadian firms looking to work with the US federal government must understand and comply with the FAR and DFAR clauses that apply to their contracts. FAR includes provisions that ensure foreign firms, including those from Canada, meet the same stringent standards as domestic companies in areas such as quality assurance, pricing, and ethical conduct. One of the key FAR clauses for Canadian companies is FAR 52.225, which addresses the Buy American Act and Trade Agreements Act. Under these clauses, Canadian products and services can be used in federal contracts due to trade agreements between the US and Canada, such as the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement). This often provides Canadian firms with a competitive edge over firms from countries without similar agreements.\\n\\nUnder DFAR, Canadian firms must navigate additional requirements when dealing with the DoD. DFAR clauses, such as DFAR 252.225, impose specific regulations on the acquisition of defense articles and services, ensuring compliance with national security measures and restrictions on sourcing materials from certain countries. Canadian firms benefit from the US-Canada Defense Production Sharing Agreement, which allows them to participate in US defense procurements on nearly equal footing with US firms. However, they must still comply with cybersecurity requirements as outlined in DFAR 252.204-7012, which mandates that contractors protect Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) within their information systems. By thoroughly understanding and adhering to these FAR and DFAR clauses, Canadian firms can successfully engage in federal contracts while ensuring compliance with US regulations and standards.\\n\\nTraditional US Federal Market Entry Budgets:\\n\\nTraditionally, Canadian companies seeking to tap into the vast US federal marketplace must be prepared to invest in their success.

It's a great stepping stone for companies looking to expand their global presence in the US.\\n\\nCanadian companies seeking to work with the US federal government can leverage several specific programs and strategies to overcome common challenges and maximize opportunities.\\n\\nCanadian Commercial Corporation (CCC):\\n\\nThe CCC is a federal Crown corporation that acts as a prime contractor with the US federal government and subcontracts to Canadian companies. This government-to-government contracting model provides assurance to US federal buyers about the reliability of Canadian suppliers. The CCC facilitates access to US Department of Defense (DoD) contracts, helping Canadian companies navigate the complexities of US federal procurement.\\n\\nFederal Technology Transfer (FCT) Program:\\n\\nThe FCT program is designed to commercialize federally developed technology through partnerships with industry. Canadian companies can participate in this program to develop and market products based on US federal technology, fostering innovation and cross-border collaboration.\\n\\nOther Transaction Authority (OTA):\\n\\nOTAs are flexible procurement instruments used by the DoD and other federal agencies to acquire research and development and prototype projects. Canadian companies can operationalize OTAs by partnering with US firms or consortia that have access to these agreements. This approach allows for quicker and more flexible acquisition processes compared to traditional federal contracts.\\n\\nUnderstanding and Leveraging Procurement Vehicles:\\n\\nCanadian startups can utilize various procurement vehicles, such as the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule, which provides access to federal, state, and local government buyers with guidance from government acquisition law firms. While Canadian companies don't qualify for small business set-asides, they can compete for full and open competition contracts and subcontracting opportunities with some restrictions. Check the Federal Business Accelerator program for building a US federal government strategy.\\n\\nRelationship Building and Local Government Consultants:\\n\\nBuilding strong relationships with US government agencies and utilizing local government consultants can significantly enhance a Canadian company's ability to secure contracts. These consultants can provide insights into procurement processes, introduce key stakeholders, and help navigate regulatory requirements. Complete the Federal Business Accelerator program before you embark on this step, so you don't waste your funds on unneeded consultants.\\n\\nCybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC):\\n\\nThe CMMC initiative aims to enhance cybersecurity practices within the defense industrial base. Canadian companies providing cybersecurity solutions can align their offerings with CMMC requirements to better position themselves for DoD contracts.\\n\\nFederal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP):\\n\\nCanadian companies offering cloud services can seek FedRAMP authorization to provide secure cloud solutions to US federal agencies. This certification demonstrates compliance with stringent security standards, making it easier to compete for federal contracts.\\n\\nJoint Certification Program (JCP):\\n\\nThe JCP certifies companies to access unclassified military technical data. Updating certifications and ensuring compliance with JCP standards can help Canadian companies engage more effectively with the DoD and other federal entities.\\n\\nState and Local Government (SLED) Accounts:\\n\\nAdhering to initiatives like the White House memorandum M-22-09, which mandates cybersecurity and IT modernization efforts, can open doors for Canadian companies to participate in state and local government contracts. Understanding and aligning with these initiatives is crucial for success.\\n\\nCybersecurity within K12 Educational Institutions:\\n\\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) encourages collaboration with state planning committees to leverage funding for cybersecurity improvements in K12 education. Canadian companies can participate in grant-approved services by aligning their offerings with state and federal cybersecurity initiatives.\\n\\nMarket Research and Understanding Buying Patterns:\\n\\nConduct thorough market research to understand the buying patterns of US government agencies, particularly the DoD. Identifying procurement trends and aligning offerings with agency needs can increase the likelihood of securing contracts. As mentioned, the Federal Business Accelerator program can help.\\n\\nCompliance and Certifications:\\n\\nObtain necessary certifications, such as CMMC and FedRAMP, to meet compliance requirements. Staying updated on regulatory changes and ensuring adherence to standards is critical for maintaining eligibility and competitiveness.\\n\\nStrategic Partnerships:\\n\\nForm strategic partnerships with US-based companies to leverage their existing relationships and contractual mechanisms. Joint ventures and subcontracting can provide a pathway to enter the US federal market. Check out the Teaming Course in the Federal Business Accelerator for building the most effective and efficient Strategic partnerships.\\n\\nGovernment Relations and Advocacy:\\n\\nEngage in government relations and advocacy efforts to stay informed about policy changes and emerging opportunities.

Ensure you are subscribed to the ScaleUP USA podcast and the Federal Business Accelerator bundle for valuable tips and tricks to grow your federal business.\\n\\nBy leveraging these programs and strategies, Canadian companies can effectively navigate the US federal procurement landscape, overcome challenges, and secure valuable contracts with US government agencies.\\n\\nOne of the questions we often receive is whether Green Card holders and H1B visa holders can work in the US federal government ecosystem. Our research has found the following:\\n\\nGreen Card Holders (Permanent Residents):\\n\\nGreen card holders are generally eligible to work directly for the US federal government as employees, enjoying the same employment rights and benefits as US citizens in many agencies. This includes opportunities for security clearances and career advancement within federal agencies. Unlike H1B visa holders, green card holders do not require sponsorship from a private employer to secure government positions.\\n\\nH1B Visa Holders: Doing Government Contracts as a Contractor:\\n\\nH1B visa holders can contribute to US federal government projects indirectly through employment with private companies that hold certain government agency contracts. These companies sponsor the H1B visa and manage employment compliance with US immigration laws and regulations. Generally, H1B visa holders cannot become government employees directly, unless specific legislative exemptions or rare program provisions apply.\\n\\nAdditional Considerations:\\n\\nBoth H1B visa and green card holders may need to meet security clearance requirements for certain federal roles, with processes varying based on agency, individual circumstances, and position prerequisites. Employers engaging H1B visa holders for government contracts must also ensure compliance with all relevant immigration laws and contractual obligations stipulated by federal agencies.\\n\\nJoin us at www.scaleupUS.com and begin your journey to federal contracting success today. The right guidance can make all the difference.\\n\\nFinal Reminder: Stay Informed:\\n\\nPlease note that federal government programs, personnel, budgets, and priorities change frequently.

       "    'title': 'Novel Deep Learning Technique for Editing and Generating High-Quality Holograms',\n",
       "    'body': 'Researchers overcome noise and low resolution of extracted light field from conventionally generated holograms using a novel deep-learning method\\n\\nModifying holograms requires extracting light field data of the 3D object portrayed by the hologram. However, current methods for extracting this data result introduce noise and low resolution, degrading the final image quality. To address this, researchers employed a deep learning technique, which effectively eliminated noise and improved the quality of light field data extracted from holograms. This innovative method allows the editing of light field data and consequently the generation of high-quality holograms.\\n\\nHolography is a fascinating technology that allows the generation of three-dimensional (3D) images, called holograms, with applications in a wide variety of fields. However, there are several challenges in the way of achieving commercial-grade holograms due to the lack of appropriate optical devices, among which, the editing of holograms is a key issue. To edit a hologram, accurate information on the 3D object portrayed by the hologram is required. Despite much research, techniques for extracting this information are still not known.\\n\\nOne way to extract the 3D object information is to acquire light field data instead of an actual 3D model. Light field data consists of light rays emanating from a 3D object, represented as a set of views from multiple angles. This light field data can then be modified and recreated as a hologram using a computer. In this process, the quality of the extracted light field data is the most important factor that influences the quality of the final modified hologram. Light field data can be extracted by passing the angular spectrum of the light from a 3D object through a band-pass filter. However, this method has several issues, including low spatial resolution, blurring and speckle noise, which degrade image quality during extraction.\\n\\nTo address these issues, Dr. Dae-youl Park from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute in Korea employed an innovative new method for processing extracted light-field data. \"We employed a deep learning technique to improve the quality of the light field, which compensates for the inevitable degradation in image quality of extracted light field and enables the creation of an edited hologram with the same quality as the original image\", explains Dr. Park. Their study was published in the ETRI Journal on 5 July, 2023.\\n\\nTo remove speckle noise and blurring, and to improve spatial resolution, the researchers employed a generative adversarial network based deep learning model. This model is comprised of two networks: a generator and a discriminator. The function of the generator model is to generate an image similar to the real image, while the discriminator compares the real and generated images. During the training of this model, the extracted light field data from the DIV2K image set was used as input to the generator to create a speckle and noise-free image and the comparisons provided by the discriminator were used to improve the overall performance of the generator.\\n\\nThe trained generator was then tested by generating holograms of various objects with different depth characteristics. Testing revealed that the model was able to generate high-quality holograms regardless of the hologram generation method or the position of the bandpass filter.\\n\\nHighlighting the importance of the study, Dr. Park remarks: \"Holographic technology will bring about significant changes for us. It will transition the way we convey information from the current method of displaying information on 2D screens to communication in a 3D space. We believe that our method will play a key role in this transition.\"\\n\\nOverall, this study marks a significant step in the advancement of holographic technology!\\n\\nReference\\n\\nTitle of original paper: Improving the quality of light-field data extracted from a hologram using deep learning\\n\\nAbout the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)\\n\\nEstablished in 1976, ETRI is a non-profit government-funded research institute in Daedeok Science Town in Daejeon and is one of the leading research institutes in the wireless communications domain. It has filed more than 2500 patents. Equipped with state-of-the-art labs, this institute strives for social and economic development through technology research.\\n\\nAbout the author\\n\\nDae-Youl Park received his PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering from Inha University, Incheon, Republic of Korea, in 2022. Since 2022, he has been a member of senior researcher at the Digital Holography Research Section at the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Republic of Korea. His current research interests include computer-generated holograms, self-interference incoherent digital holography and artificial intelligence.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Catamoto $CATA airdrops are essentially distribution events where free tokens, specifically Catamoto $CATA or Catamoto $CATA-related assets, are sent to wallet addresses of participants within the cryptocurrency community. This method of distribution serves as a marketing strategy, intended to heighten awareness and broaden the distribution of the token. Such events may coincide with a new project launch, a blockchain fork, or as part of promotional activities, effectively placing the digital asset directly into the hands of potential users.\\n\\nIn the cryptocurrency ecosystem, airdrops are often perceived as windfalls, akin to unexpected gifts. However, to effectively participate, one must have a working knowledge of wallets and the necessary security measures to safeguard digital assets.

These transactions are executed through the blockchain network, engaging community participants in a novel manner.\\n\\nAs digital strategies evolve, airdrops are redefining marketing within the cryptocurrency domain, granting projects a means to generate buzz and rewarding engagement. They act as catalysts for adoption, seeding the market with tokens of potential value and igniting a foundational user network.\\n\\nA single Catamoto $CATA airdrop event can ripple through the network, magnifying outreach exponentially.\\n\\nWhen executed with precision, the undertaking of these airdrops entails meticulous planning and a robust technical framework facilitating the distribution. Indeed, they are more than mere giveaways: airdrops innovate user acquisition, solidifying a project\\'s standing within the community while providing tangible value to the recipients. This symbiotic mechanism celebrates the participatory ethos of the digital economy.\\n\\nAirdrops in the cryptocurrency arena are diverse, catering to different scenarios and objectives within the digital assets space.\\n\\nThe method of distribution can dramatically affect participants\\' engagement with the project.\\n\\nAccurate targeting and strategic implementation are pivotal for the success of any airdrop campaign, ensuring that the tokens reach the intended audience.\\n\\nAirdrop eligibility is often a clearly defined set of criteria that potential recipients must meet to receive free cryptocurrency tokens.\\n\\nBeware of fraudulent schemes masquerading as airdrops; thorough vetting and research are indisputable prerequisites for safety. Look for official announcements and verified community discussions to authenticate airdrops before participation.\\n\\nAs an imperative, examine the project\\'s whitepaper or roadmap and evaluate the team\\'s credibility (LinkedIn profiles, past projects) to ensure aligning with a genuine endeavor. Substantial due diligence is necessary to sift through the noise and identify legitimate airdrop opportunities with real value.\\n\\nAlways remember: Invest time in research to avoid the pitfalls of alluring, yet dubious \"free\" cryptocurrency offers.\\n\\nDiligent research ensures engagement with valid airdrops, distinguishing genuine opportunities from nefarious traps.\\n\\nRemaining ever-vigilant against fraudulent activities must be your paramount guideline in this venture.\\n\\nUnderstanding the token\\'s underlying technology and potential market impact is equally vital for assessing long-term value.\\n\\nExcessive urgency in claims, urging immediate action to claim your tokens, is a strong indicator of a scam.\\n\\nUnsolicited offers via email or social media require scrutiny.\\n\\nLegitimate airdrops do not require transferring funds or sharing private keys. Demands for upfront payment or sensitive information are red flags.\\n\\nExercise caution with airdrops claiming affiliation with well-known brands without clear proof. Often, scammers misrepresent associations to lure trust and credibility in unwary recipients. Look for official endorsements and verify through reliable sources before engaging or providing any personal information.\\n\\nNavigating the world of cryptocurrency airdrops necessitates caution and a reliance on credible, verified sources for obtaining accurate and up-to-date information. Credibility and expertise underline the importance of these sources, ensuring one is apprised of genuine opportunities.\\n\\nFor real-time updates, social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit can be invaluable, provided you follow authoritative industry experts and official project accounts.\\n\\nCrypto forums, such as Catamoto $CATAtalk and CryptoCompare, provide community-reviewed airdrops with expansive discussions shedding light on legitimacy and potential.\\n\\nOfficial websites and whitepapers offer the most direct insight into the project\\'s intentions, capabilities, and the team behind the technology, often laying out detailed roadmaps and tokenomics.\\n\\nCorporate partnerships and endorsements function as additional layers of verification. Monitoring news outlets and official press releases can often indicate the authenticity and potential trajectory of a project.\\n\\nLastly, cross-referencing multiple sources helps in establishing a composite view. Always remain critical and apply due diligence when assessing airdrop legitimacy and value proposition.\\n\\nWhen it comes to engaging with Catamoto $CATA or cryptocurrency airdrops, informed participation is paramount. A thorough vetting process that scrutinizes the source, the project\\'s underlying technology, and inherent value should precede engagement. Adopting a strategic approach and utilizing tools such as airdrop aggregators can streamline the search for legitimate opportunities. It\\'s important to understand the eligibility criteria, which may include holding certain cryptocurrencies, having an active presence on a platform, or performing specific tasks. Secure participation requires a robust understanding of smart contract interactions and the potential implications for your digital wallet security. Always proceed with caution, prioritizing security and legitimacy over the allure of \"free\" tokens.\\n\\nPrior to initiating any interaction with a Catamoto $CATA airdrop, establishing a secure wallet is paramount. The wallet serves as the repository for your digital assets and keeps them shielded from unauthorized access. It\\'s essential to choose a wallet that has a robust security framework to fortify against potential breaches.\\n\\nWhen selecting a cryptocurrency wallet, pay particular attention to the wallet\\'s reputation and track record. A high-quality wallet will integrate multiple layers of security, including two-factor authentication, encryption, and regularly updated software. It is also advisable to opt for hardware wallets or cold storage solutions for higher value holdings due to their enhanced security features. Consideration for these aspects ensures that the airdropped tokens remain under your exclusive control.\\n\\nAfter securing a suitable wallet, be sure to safeguard your private keys -- the alphanumeric strings that grant access to your assets. Never share them with third parties and avoid storing them on internet-connected devices to minimize exposure to hackers. Double-checking all addresses before executing any transactions is vital to prevent loss of assets due to human error or clipboard hijacking malware.\\n\\nFinally, maintain a vigilant posture by frequently monitoring for software updates from your wallet provider. Security is not a one-off task but a continual process. Employing multi-signature capabilities, if available, can add another defensive layer to your asset management. Encrypted backups in diverse locations can also preserve access to your holdings in case of accidental loss or hardware failure. Always approach digital currency storage with the gravitas it demands, acknowledging that the onus for safeguarding these assets rests solely upon the user.\\n\\nThe alluring prospect of free Catamoto $CATA airdrops must be tempered with a clear understanding of regulatory adherence. As cryptocurrency gains further traction, regulatory bodies like the SEC and IRS are becoming increasingly vigilant and expect participants to conduct their affairs within the framework of the law.\\n\\nIgnorance of tax obligations is not a viable defense in the eyes of tax authorities. Cryptocurrency airdrops, despite their gratuitous nature, may be taxable events under certain jurisdictions, such as the United States.\\n\\nTherefore, recipients of Catamoto $CATA airdrops should maintain meticulous records of their transactions. This includes dates, market values at the time of receipt (establishing a basis for capital gains calculations), and the details of the airdrop event.\\n\\nMany nations now require exchanges and wallet providers to report cryptocurrency transactions to tax authorities. This transparency means that the onus to report accurately falls on both the service providers and the users alike.\\n\\nParticipation in airdrops should not be made without prior consultation with a tax professional. Understanding the implications of receiving a new asset and reporting it correctly can prevent potential legal and financial repercussions in the future.\\n\\nUltimately, due diligence is vital for anyone engaging with cryptocurrency airdrops. Proper compliance and tax planning are integral to ensuring that these ventures into digital currencies remain both profitable and lawful.\\n\\nIn the quest for maximizing potential airdrop rewards, strategic engagement is paramount. Participants must scrutinize each airdrop\\'s requirements and underlying value proposition to discern merit and potential return on investment.\\n\\nTo leverage airdrops to their fullest extent, one should consider diversifying across various blockchain ecosystems and staying abreast of community news and updates. This proactive stance facilitates early participation in promising airdrops, thus optimizing the chances of higher payouts.\\n\\nEngage with caution and diligence, for \"free\" tokens may bear hidden costs, especially considering transaction fees and tax implications. Always assess the full spectrum of an airdrop\\'s impact on your digital asset portfolio.\\n\\nAirdrop Aggregators function as specialized platforms streamlining the discovery and participation process in cryptocurrency airdrops. They provide a curated list of active and upcoming airdrops, reducing the complexity for users.\\n\\nThey act as a central hub for airdrop information. Their interfaces often allow for direct engagement with the airdrop mechanism, hence simplifying the claim process.\\n\\nThe essence of an airdrop aggregator lies in its ability to vet and list various cryptocurrency airdrops, sometimes offering exclusive opportunities. This centralization can save extensive time and effort for participants seeking to broaden their portfolio with minimal risk and significant potential gain.\\n\\nAn adept use of airdrop aggregators can significantly mitigate the risks associated with the often chaotic landscape of free token distributions. By following aggregator vetted lists and compliance standards, users may navigate the terrain of cryptocurrency airdrops with greater foresight and security. Their role is akin to a lighthouse guiding ships -- the aggregators direct users to potentially valuable digital assets amidst a sea of incessant offerings.\\n\\nCommunity participation is fundamental in airdrops.\\n\\nEffective airdrop campaigns are predicated on a strong community relationship. They typically require users to engage with the project on various platforms, which might include social media followings, forum participation, or content creation. Consequently, projects aiming to distribute airdrops frequently leverage these activities to bolster their user base and enhance network value.\\n\\nEngagement is the lynchpin of airdrop success.\\n\\nTo partake, a harmonious blend of vigilance and interaction is paramount. Individuals are commonly prompted to join telegraphic channels or disseminate information on social networks. This symbiotic exchange -- promoters garner visibility while recipients gain tokens -- frames the essence of community-oriented strategies within the airdrop paradigm.\\n\\nAirdrops rely on mutual efficacy of community and project.\\n\\nThe virtuous cycle of community engagement leads to enriched dialogues, user education, and more profound allegiance to the project. By cultivating active participation throughout 2023, projects aspire to form robust ecosystems. These endeavors aim to foster lasting relationships that extend beyond the ephemeral excitement of receiving free tokens, thereby embedding a community\\'s commitment to the project\\'s longevity.\\n\\nAirdrops can be a legal way of distributing digital assets to individuals. The legality of airdrops depends on various factors and can vary from country to country. In general, if the airdrop complies with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is conducted, it can be considered legal.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that airdrops can sometimes fall under securities regulations. If the tokens or assets being distributed qualify as securities, additional requirements may apply. In such cases, issuers need to ensure compliance with securities laws, which may include registration or exemptions from registration.\\n\\nThe legality of airdrops can also depend on the purpose and nature of the distribution. If the airdrop is used to promote a fraudulent scheme or facilitate illegal activities, it can be considered illegal.\\n\\nAdditionally, tax laws may come into play when it comes to airdrops. Depending on the jurisdiction, recipients of airdropped tokens may have tax obligations related to the acquisition or disposal of these assets. It\\'s important to consult with a tax professional or legal advisor to understand the specific tax implications in your jurisdiction.\\n\\nIn summary, airdrops have the potential to be legal, but it\\'s crucial to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\\n\\nIf you\\'re wondering how to convert airdrop to cash, there are a few steps you can take. First, you will need to find a reputable cryptocurrency exchange where you can trade your airdrop tokens for a cryptocurrency that can be converted to cash. It\\'s important to do thorough research and choose a reliable exchange platform.\\n\\nOnce you have selected an exchange, you will need to create an account and go through the necessary verification processes.

This usually involves copying the wallet address provided by the exchange and initiating a transfer from your current wallet or platform where you hold your airdrop tokens.\\n\\nOnce the tokens arrive in your exchange wallet, you can then proceed to sell them for a cryptocurrency that can be converted to cash, such as Catamoto $CATA or Ethereum. This can be done by placing a sell order on the exchange, specifying the amount you want to sell and the price you are willing to sell at.\\n\\nOnce your sell order is executed, you will have successfully converted your airdrop tokens to a cryptocurrency. From there, you can withdraw the cryptocurrency to another platform or wallet that supports cash withdrawals, and follow their specific process to convert the cryptocurrency to cash.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that the process of converting airdrop to cash may vary slightly depending on the specific exchange and cryptocurrency you are dealing with.

       "    'title': 'Psychology in UX Design: The Crucial Role of Soft Skills',\n",
       "    'body': \"As someone with a background in Psychology venturing into UX design, I've been keen to explore the intersection between these two fields. Psychology has long played a significant role in UX design, providing insights that help designers predict user interactions and create more intuitive interfaces. By understanding users' cognitive limitations and abilities, as well as managing their cognitive load, designers can develop interfaces that are easy to navigate, reducing frustration and enhancing satisfaction.\\n\\nIn this article, I will delve into the importance of soft skills in UX design, supported by peer-reviewed psychology studies. I will explore how empathy, communication, emotional intelligence, and persuasion, all rooted in psychological principles, are essential for creating user-centered, engaging, and effective designs.\\n\\nEmpathy allows designers to step into the users' shoes, understanding their frustrations and motivations. For example, when designing a healthcare app, an empathetic approach might reveal that users need simple, jargon-free language and quick access to critical features. This understanding results in a design that is not only functional but also comforting and accessible to users who may be stressed or anxious about their health. A study published in the Journal of User Experience found that designers who employ empathetic approaches such as the example above, are better able to anticipate and address user needs and pain points, leading to more effective and satisfying user experiences (Fischer & Hornecker, 2012).\\n\\nIn UX design, clear communication is vital for collaborating with cross-functional teams such as developers and business stakeholders. For instance, when working on a new e-commerce website, a UX designer must effectively communicate user research findings and design rationale to ensure that all team members are aligned with the user-centered goals of the project. This leads to a cohesive and user-friendly final product. Research in the Journal of Applied Psychology shows that effective communication significantly impacts team collaboration and project success (Bakker et al., 2011), showing that clear communication between team members and stakeholders will reduce misunderstandings and errors.\\n\\nEmotional intelligence helps UX designers handle feedback and conflict constructively. For example, during usability testing, a designer with high emotional inteligence will effectively interpret users' non-verbal cues and emotional responses, gaining deeper insights into their experiences. Also in team settings, it will help resolve disagreements and maintain a collaborative atmosphere, ensuring that the project progresses smoothly. A study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that individuals with high emotional intelligence are better at managing interpersonal relationships and navigating social complexities (Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2008).\\n\\nPersuasion is essential when presenting design ideas to stakeholders who may prioritize business goals over user experience. A UX designer can use persuasive techniques to highlight the benefits of a user-centered design, such as increased user satisfaction and long-term customer loyalty. For example, by presenting data from user research and case studies, the designer can convince stakeholders to invest in a more intuitive and user-friendly interface.\\n\\nStudy Insight: A study in the Journal of Consumer Research discusses how persuasive communication can influence decision-making and behavior (Cialdini, 2001). For UX designers, being persuasive means effectively advocating for user needs and justifying design decisions.\\n\\nBy integrating insights from psychology, UX designers can create more user-centered, engaging, and successful products. These skills not only improve the design process but also foster better collaboration and understanding within teams, ultimately leading to more innovative and user-friendly solutions.\",\n",

This airdrop aimed to combine the privacy features of Zclassic with the security and familiarity of BaoBaoSol $BAOS. Holders of both BaoBaoSol $BAOS and Zclassic received BaoBaoSol $BAOS Private at a 1:1 ratio.\\n\\nBaoBaoSol $BAOS Private implemented the zk-SNARKs privacy protocol, allowing for anonymous transactions while still maintaining the transparency and security of the BaoBaoSol $BAOS blockchain. The airdrop generated significant interest and participation from both the BaoBaoSol $BAOS and Zclassic communities.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the famous BAOS airdrops that have occurred throughout history. Airdrops continue to be a popular method for distributing new coins and engaging cryptocurrency communities. Whether it\\'s for marketing purposes, network expansion, or community building, airdrops play a significant role in the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in learning more about BAOS airdrops and their impact on the crypto market, you can visit Famous BAOS Airdrops Throughout History.\\n\\nBtc airdrops have become a significant phenomenon in the cryptocurrency space, offering a glimpse into the future of token distribution and community engagement. As the crypto landscape evolves, it\\'s crucial to analyze current trends and make informed predictions about the direction in which Btc airdrops are heading.\\n\\nOne of the key trends shaping the future of Btc airdrops is the emphasis on quality over quantity. In the early days of airdrops, projects often distributed tokens widely to attract attention. However, this approach has led to issues such as token dumping and low engagement. Moving forward, we can expect to see a shift towards targeted airdrops that focus on specific communities or demographics.\\n\\nAnother emerging trend is the integration of airdrops with blockchain technology beyond Ethereum. While Ethereum has been the primary platform for airdrops due to its smart contract capabilities, other blockchains like Btc are gaining traction for token distribution.

By leveraging testnets, projects can refine their tokenomics and ensure a smoother rollout of their airdrop.\\n\\nWhen considering the future of Btc airdrops, it\\'s essential to address the issue of user participation. Despite the potential rewards, many users are hesitant to participate in airdrops due to concerns about privacy and security. To overcome this barrier, projects need to implement user-friendly strategies that prioritize transparency and security.\\n\\nIn terms of rewards, we may see a shift towards non-monetary incentives such as access to exclusive features or governance rights. These alternative rewards can create long-term value for participants and foster a sense of community ownership over the project.\\n\\nOn the promotional front, social media platforms like Twitter will continue to play a crucial role in spreading awareness about Btc airdrops. However, projects must devise creative strategies to stand out amidst the noise and capture the attention of their target audience.\\n\\nAs we look ahead, the future of Btc airdrops appears promising but challenging. By staying abreast of industry trends and adopting innovative strategies, projects can maximize the potential of airdrops as a tool for decentralized token distribution and community building.\\n\\nFor more insights on Btc airdrops and the latest developments in the crypto space, visit https://url-medium.com/.',\n",

       "    'body': 'The Coming Wave, and Artifical Intellligance, Read Write Own Book Summary\\n\\nThe digital age has been marked by a surge of interest in the potential of various technologies, and none more so than blockchain. This technology has been touted as a revolutionary tool that could change not just the world of finance, but the very fabric of the internet itself. The promise of blockchain technology lies in its ability to create a decentralized network of computers that can transfer value without the need for central authorities. This radical shift in how we transfer and store value could potentially disrupt the dominance of Big Tech and usher in a new era of the internet that is more open, inclusive, and aligned with the values of its users.\\n\\nOne of the most distinctive features of blockchain technology is the concept of digital ownership. This revolutionary concept is manifested through the use of tokens, which can be either fungible or non-fungible (NFTs). These tokens represent ownership of a digital asset and can be exchanged, bought, or sold in the same way as physical assets. This new form of digital ownership could redefine the way we think about ownership and exchange in the digital realm, offering new opportunities for creativity, collaboration, and innovation.\\n\\nThe potential applications of blockchain technology are vast and varied. For instance, blockchain could be used to create decentralized virtual worlds, where users can interact and create value in an environment free from central control. It could also enable the creation of user-governed social networks, where users have a say in the rules and operation of the platform. Furthermore, blockchain could facilitate the emergence of fluid, token-based organizations that can adapt and evolve in response to user needs and market dynamics.\\n\\nThis potential future, known as the \"read-write-own\" era, represents a significant shift in how the internet functions. In this new era, the economic benefits and governance rights are spread to the communities of users themselves, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants. This decentralization of power and value could lead to a more equitable and democratic internet, where users have a greater stake in the platforms and communities they contribute to.\\n\\nHowever, the transition to this new era is not without its challenges. One of the most significant is the need to ensure that these new technologies are used responsibly and ethically. Artificial intelligence and genetic engineering, two transformative technologies that are closely linked with blockchain, hold the potential to either elevate or devastate the coming decades of human history. As we navigate this new technological landscape, it is crucial that we approach these developments with a clear understanding of their potential risks and rewards, and strive to ensure that they are used in a way that benefits all of humanity.\\n\\nAnother challenge that we face in this new era is in the realm of marketing. With the rise of artificial intelligence, the quality and relevance of content have become increasingly important. In this new digital landscape, the success of a business or a platform is no longer just about who has the deepest pockets for advertising spend. Rather, it is about who can cleverly use AI to understand and predict their audience\\'s desires and needs, and deliver content that meets these demands.\\n\\nAs we navigate this new technological landscape, we must also be mindful of the potential for bias in both AI and blockchain technology. Just as academic publications can be influenced by certain biases, so too can these new technologies. This is a significant concern, as these technologies have the potential to shape our world in profound and far-reaching ways. We must ensure that these tools are used in a transparent and equitable manner, rather than simply reinforcing existing power structures and inequalities.\\n\\nIn the face of these challenges, it is essential that we remain curious and keep asking questions. We must constantly evaluate the data and statistics we encounter, and ensure that we are not being led astray by misleading or incomplete information. As we interact with these new technologies, we must strive to maintain a critical and informed perspective.\\n\\nOne way to do this is to memorize a few landmark numbers. Having these figures in your head can make it easier to understand the relative significance of other numbers that we encounter. This simple practice can help us to avoid being misled by distorted statistics, and ensure that we have a clear and accurate understanding of the information we encounter.\\n\\nWe must also be aware of the potential for manipulation in the presentation of data. For instance, the definition of terms can be manipulated to distort the facts and advance a particular perspective. Always question the definitions used in a claim before you accept or refute it. This practice can help us to see through misleading arguments and ensure that we have a clear and accurate understanding of the issues at hand.\\n\\nFinally, as we venture into this new era of the internet, we must keep in mind that these new technologies are not just tools, but potential game-changers. They have the potential to radically reshape our world and the way we interact with it. But with this potential comes a responsibility to use these tools wisely and ethically. As we navigate this new digital landscape, let\\'s keep our minds open, our eyes on the prize, and our actions aligned with the goal of creating a more open, inclusive, and value-aligned digital world.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Quantum Communiqué: a Concept for Instant Interstellar Communication',\n",
       "    'body': 'Imagine a future where messages travel faster than light, bridging the vast distances between stars instantaneously. This isn\\'t the stuff of distant science fiction; it\\'s on the brink of becoming reality with a revolutionary technology that harnesses the enigmatic principles of quantum mechanics. Introducing the Quantum Communiqué, a device that promises to transform interstellar communication by leveraging the unique properties of quantum entanglement and advanced materials science.\\n\\nAt the heart of this groundbreaking technology are two large, ultra-thin sheets of graphene, each about the size of a standard computer monitor (though in principle any desirable size could be achieved). Graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional lattice, is renowned for its remarkable electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The key innovation lies in the precise manufacturing of these graphene sheets, ensuring they possess an identical number of atoms in an exact 2D matrix. What makes this setup extraordinary is that each atom in these graphene sheets is quantum entangled with its corresponding atom in the other sheet, creating a direct and instantaneous link between the two.\\n\\nOne sheet resides on Earth, within a sophisticated control center, while the other embarks on an interstellar journey aboard a spaceship. When a person speaks in front of the graphene sheet on Earth, the sound waves generate minuscule vibrations on its surface. Thanks to the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, these vibrations are instantly mirrored on the distant graphene sheet aboard the spaceship, regardless of the light-years separating them. This instant transmission of information defies the classical constraints of space and time, providing a real-time communication channel that could revolutionize space exploration and beyond.\\n\\nToday\\'s surveillance technology already exploits the subtle vibrations on window panes to eavesdrop on conversations inside buildings. High-precision laser microphones can detect these vibrations and amplify them into audible sound. The Quantum Communiqué employs a similar principle but on a quantum level. When sound waves impact the graphene sheet, they induce atomic-scale vibrations that are detected and translated into usable audio at the other end, thanks to the quantum entanglement between the atoms. This process ensures that communication is not only instantaneous but also incredibly precise and reliable.\\n\\nThe theoretical foundation for this concept is grounded in well-established scientific principles. Quantum entanglement, famously described by Albert Einstein as \"spooky action at a distance,\" has been experimentally validated numerous times. Researchers have demonstrated entanglement over distances exceeding 1,200 kilometers, and advancements in quantum state transmission continue to push these boundaries. Graphene, discovered in 2004, has rapidly become a focal point in materials science due to its exceptional properties and potential applications, including its use in high-speed electronics, sensors, and even quantum devices.\\n\\nIntegrating these cutting-edge advancements, the Quantum Communiqué represents a fusion of quantum physics and nanotechnology. It promises to overcome one of the most daunting challenges in space exploration: the communication delay caused by the vast distances between celestial bodies. As humanity prepares for manned missions to Mars and dreams of venturing even further into the cosmos, the need for reliable, instantaneous communication becomes paramount. This technology not only paves the way for real-time conversations between Earth and spacecraft but also has profound implications for data transmission, remote operations, and the coordination of complex interstellar missions.\\n\\nThe Quantum Communiqué heralds a new era in communication technology, where distance is no longer a barrier. By harnessing the power of quantum entanglement and the remarkable properties of graphene, this device offers a tantalizing glimpse into a future where interstellar communication is as seamless and immediate as a phone call across town, just as we\\'ve become accustomed to through countless sci-fi narratives.',\n",

Ensure the request is legitimate before granting connection permissions to avoid security risks.\\n\\nFor a seamless experience, use wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect, or Coinbase Wallet, which are compatible with DappRadar. Ensure your wallet is set to the correct network that matches the airdrop\\'s blockchain.\\n\\nOnce your wallet is connected, DappRadar can display relevant airdrops alongside other financial tools and services.

They act as incentives for potential investors and early adopters, by offering a portion of the new token supply at no cost. To the recipients, these assets provide an opportunity to diversify their portfolios and engage with emerging blockchain projects with minimal financial risk.\\n\\nAirdrop rewards are essentially free tokens distributed, typically as a marketing strategy to widen token distribution and foster project engagement.\\n\\nBy disseminating these digital incentives, blockchain ventures aim to bootstrap their economies and ignite network effects, thereby multiplying the utility and potential value gain.\\n\\nA single airdrop event can significantly bolster user numbers and token liquidity.\\n\\nAirdrop campaigns may vary considerably in structure: some require a simple sign-up, whereas others necessitate active participation or holding a particular asset to be eligible.

Regularly check DappRadar\\'s tracking tools and set alerts to stay ahead of new airdrop announcements. By doing so, you will be well positioned to capitalize on valuable opportunities that align with your cryptocurrency portfolio and investment strategy.\\n\\nExercise due diligence and skepticism.\\n\\nWhen searching for reputable airdrops, meticulous research is paramount.

A vital step includes verification of the smart contract -- ensure it is publicly verifiable and has undergone a credible audit. Moreover, engage with the community and developers through social media channels to obtain a holistic understanding of the project\\'s value proposition and roadmap.\\n\\nBeware of any red flags signaling fraud.\\n\\nAnticipate and recognize indications of a duplicitous airdrop. Vague details, lack of transparency about token distribution, and unrealistic promises are often telltale signs. Use DappRadar\\'s insight to discern the legitimacy of the opportunity and confirm that it aligns with the current cryptographic standards and best practices.\\n\\nLegitimacy is substantiated by community trust.\\n\\nThe longevity of a project is often correlated with the strength of its community.

Hastily claiming airdrops without due diligence can lead to wasted effort and potential exposure to risks. Only advance once you\\'ve thoroughly vetted the opportunity using DappRadar\\'s analytics.\\n\\nExpediency should not trump security. For a seamless claiming process, ensure the compatibility of your wallet with the airdrop, then monitor DappRadar for verified airdrop events. When claiming, always use a secure connection and avoid any action that may compromise your wallet\\'s integrity. Furthermore, timing is key; be prompt in claiming airdrops as delays can sometimes mean missing out due to token allocation limits or expiry dates.\\n\\nAutomated alerts enhance claiming efficiency.

Apply discretion -- opting for airdrops aligning with your investment strategy. Detailed information on each project aids in discerning the airdrop\\'s legitimacy and potential.\\n\\nLastly, follow the explicit claiming instructions tailored for each airdrop. Verifying and confirming transactions might attract network fees; hence, assess the cost-benefit ratio meticulously. In case of questions or uncertainties, reference DappRadar\\'s support resources or community forums for guidance, ensuring an informed claiming process.\\n\\nPrioritize safeguarding your private keys and wallet credentials; treat them with the same diligence as you would your bank account information. Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance security.\\n\\nAlways verify the authenticity of airdrop sources. Beware of phishing attempts.\\n\\nMonitor activity on your account and set up alerts for unfamiliar transactions. These can be indicative of a breach, allowing you to take immediate action to secure your assets. Vigilance is fundamental in the prevention of unauthorized access and potential losses.\\n\\nExercise caution when connecting your wallet to new platforms. Ensure that the URL of DappRadar is correct before inputting any sensitive information, as malicious websites often mimic legitimate ones. It is advisable to use a hardware wallet for an additional layer of security when participating in airdrops. Remember, the maxim \"if it seems too good to be true, it probably is\" frequently applies to fraudulent or high-risk airdrops.\\n\\nTo get a legitimate airdrop, it is important to follow certain steps and precautions to ensure a safe and authentic experience. Firstly, thoroughly research the project or company offering the airdrop. Check their website, white paper, team members, and community engagement to verify their credibility.\\n\\nNext, be cautious of scams and fake airdrops. Never share your private key or give away sensitive personal information. Legitimate airdrops will never ask for such details. Use caution when clicking on links or providing any personal information online.\\n\\nIt is also advisable to join official announcement channels, social media groups, or forums associated with the project. This will allow you to stay updated and receive official notifications about the airdrop. Avoid unofficial channels or individuals claiming to represent the project, as they may have malicious intentions.\\n\\nRemember to always use a reliable and secure wallet to receive the airdrop tokens. Avoid using exchange wallets, as they may not support all airdrops or have the necessary features to claim them. It is recommended to use a wallet that gives you full control of your private keys.\\n\\nLastly, be patient and follow the instructions provided by the project. Some airdrops may have specific requirements or eligibility criteria. Ensure that you meet these criteria and follow the instructions accurately to receive the airdrop tokens.\\n\\nBy following these guidelines, you can increase your chances of participating in a legitimate airdrop and avoid falling victim to scams or fraudulent schemes.

The concept of airdrops, initially rooted in the world of traditional marketing, has evolved significantly since its inception. This article explores the journey of MTL airdrops from their conceptualization to their widespread adoption in the crypto community.\\n\\nThe concept of airdrops in the cryptocurrency realm traces back to the early days of Metal DAO $MTL. It was a novel strategy employed by developers to distribute new coins to the community, thereby fostering adoption and incentivizing participation. Unlike traditional ICOs or mining, which often require significant investment or technical expertise, airdrops aimed to make digital assets more accessible to a broader audience.\\n\\nInitially, airdrops were sporadic and largely experimental, with developers distributing tokens to Metal DAO $MTL holders based on various criteria such as wallet balances or participation in specific forums. These early initiatives laid the foundation for what would later become a widespread practice in the crypto space.\\n\\nAs the cryptocurrency ecosystem matured, so did the concept of airdrops. Projects began to use airdrops not only as a means of distribution but also as a strategic tool for community engagement and marketing. Platforms like GitHub and social media became instrumental in announcing and executing airdrops, allowing projects to reach a wider audience and generate buzz around their offerings.\\n\\nOne significant development in the evolution of MTL airdrops was the introduction of the snapshot mechanism. This process involves taking a snapshot of the blockchain at a specific date and time, enabling developers to determine the eligibility of wallet addresses for receiving airdropped tokens. The snapshot method enhanced transparency and efficiency in airdrop distributions, making the process more accessible and secure for participants.\\n\\nWith the increasing popularity of airdrops, dedicated platforms and websites emerged to streamline the process for both project developers and participants. These platforms serve as hubs where users can discover upcoming airdrops, learn about eligibility criteria, and track their airdrop rewards. Furthermore, they provide valuable resources such as manuals and tutorials on how to participate in airdrops effectively.\\n\\nToday, the crypto community eagerly anticipates new airdrop opportunities, viewing them as a chance to diversify their digital asset portfolios and engage with promising projects. The value of airdropped tokens can vary widely, depending on factors such as the project\\'s credibility, market demand, and distribution strategy. Nevertheless, airdrops continue to represent an innovative approach to token distribution and community building within the crypto space.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the history of MTL airdrops reflects the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the cryptocurrency industry. What began as an experimental distribution method has evolved into a strategic tool for project promotion and community engagement. With the rise of dedicated platforms and growing interest from enthusiasts, airdrops have firmly established themselves as a prominent feature of the crypto landscape.

Well, it\\'s real, and it\\'s happening in the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s break down the mechanics.

These projects aim to increase their visibility, attract new users, and stimulate community engagement. Typically, to participate, you\\'ll need to perform certain actions such as following the project\\'s Twitter account, joining their Telegram channel, or signing up for their newsletter. The specific requirements vary from one airdrop to another, but the principle remains the same: complete the tasks, and you\\'ll receive free tokens as a reward.\\n\\nBut why would projects give away valuable tokens for free?

Additionally, airdrops serve as a means of distributing tokens fairly and transparently, ensuring that they reach a diverse audience of crypto enthusiasts.\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that not all MTL airdrops are created equal. While some may offer generous rewards, others may have more modest giveaways. It\\'s essential to do your due diligence and research each airdrop carefully before participating. Check the project\\'s whitepaper, explore their website and blog, and assess their credibility within the crypto community.

Among these are airdrops and forks, both of which can significantly impact the crypto community. Understanding the disparities between these two phenomena is crucial for any crypto enthusiast.\\n\\nImagine waking up one morning to find free tokens of a new cryptocurrency sitting in your digital wallet. That\\'s essentially what an airdrop is -- a method used by crypto projects to distribute free tokens to existing holders of a particular cryptocurrency, such as Metal DAO $MTL. These tokens are usually distributed as a marketing strategy to increase awareness, user adoption, and ultimately, the value of the new crypto.\\n\\nFor example, a project might announce an airdrop of its new tokens to Metal DAO $MTL holders in a 1:1 ratio. This means that for every Metal DAO $MTL held, the participant receives an equivalent amount of the new tokens.\\n\\nIn contrast to airdrops, forks involve a fundamental change to the underlying protocol of a blockchain, resulting in the creation of a new cryptocurrency. There are two main types of forks: soft forks and hard forks.\\n\\nFor example, the Metal DAO $MTL blockchain has undergone several hard forks, resulting in the creation of new cryptocurrencies such as Metal DAO $MTL Cash and Metal DAO $MTL SV. Holders of the original Metal DAO $MTL received an equivalent amount of the new coins at the time of the fork, based on their holdings.\\n\\nWhile both airdrops and forks can potentially benefit cryptocurrency holders, it\\'s essential to understand the differences between them. Airdrops offer free tokens as a marketing incentive, while forks result in the creation of entirely new cryptocurrencies. By staying informed about upcoming airdrops and forks, crypto enthusiasts can take advantage of these opportunities to expand their portfolios.\\n\\nFor more insights into the world of cryptocurrency, stay tuned to the latest news and updates on https://url-medium.com/.\\n\\nIn the fast-paced realm of cryptocurrency, where innovation and adaptation are key, the concept of airdrops has emerged as a fascinating phenomenon. Particularly, Metal DAO $MTL (MTL) airdrops have garnered significant attention due to their potential impact on the broader crypto market.\\n\\nSo, what exactly are MTL airdrops and how do they influence the market? Let\\'s delve into the details.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL airdrops, akin to those of other cryptocurrencies, involve the distribution of free tokens to existing holders of Metal DAO $MTL. These tokens may belong to new projects, platforms, or initiatives seeking to gain traction in the crypto sphere. Essentially, it\\'s a promotional strategy aimed at fostering community engagement and increasing the visibility of the respective project.\\n\\nOne significant aspect to consider is the potential effect of MTL airdrops on the overall market dynamics. These events often lead to an influx of new coins into circulation, which can impact supply and demand dynamics. Depending on the scale and scope of the airdrop, it could influence market sentiment, trading volumes, and even the price of Metal DAO $MTL itself.\\n\\nImpact on Market Sentiment:\\n\\nEffect on Trading Volumes:\\n\\nInfluence on Metal DAO $MTL Price:\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that not all MTL airdrops are created equal. Factors such as the credibility of the issuing project, the terms of the airdrop, and the overall market conditions can significantly affect the outcome. Additionally, participants should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before engaging in any airdrop activities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, MTL airdrops represent a unique aspect of the crypto ecosystem, with the potential to influence market dynamics in various ways. By analyzing their impact on market sentiment, trading volumes, and Metal DAO $MTL\\'s price, investors can gain valuable insights into the evolving landscape of the crypto market.\\n\\nFor more details on Metal DAO $MTL airdrops and their implications, visit https://url-medium.com/.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL airdrops have become a significant phenomenon in the cryptocurrency world, often serving as marketing strategies or community-building initiatives for various blockchain projects. Airdrops involve the distribution of free coins to existing holders of a particular cryptocurrency, rewarding them for their loyalty or incentivizing further engagement. Let\\'s delve into some of the most notable MTL airdrops that have occurred throughout history.\\n\\nOne of the most famous MTL airdrops happened in August 2017 when Metal DAO $MTL underwent a hard fork, resulting in the creation of Metal DAO $MTL Cash (BCH). This airdrop occurred as a result of a fundamental disagreement within the Metal DAO $MTL community regarding the scalability of the network. Those holding Metal DAO $MTL at the time of the fork received an equivalent amount of Metal DAO $MTL Cash, effectively doubling their holdings.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL Cash aimed to address Metal DAO $MTL\\'s scalability issues by increasing the block size limit, allowing for more transactions to be processed per block. The airdrop was contentious but ultimately led to the establishment of a separate cryptocurrency with its own community and development team.\\n\\nAnother significant MTL airdrop took place in October 2017 with the creation of Metal DAO $MTL Gold (BTG). This airdrop occurred through a similar process of hard forking, with the intention of decentralizing Metal DAO $MTL mining by implementing a new mining algorithm.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL Gold aimed to make mining more accessible to individual miners by using a different algorithm that was resistant to ASICs, specialized mining hardware. Holders of Metal DAO $MTL received an equivalent amount of Metal DAO $MTL Gold during the airdrop, allowing them to diversify their holdings and participate in a new cryptocurrency project.\\n\\nIn February 2018, Metal DAO $MTL Private (MTLP) was created through a fork of Metal DAO $MTL and Zclassic. This airdrop aimed to combine the privacy features of Zclassic with the security and familiarity of Metal DAO $MTL. Holders of both Metal DAO $MTL and Zclassic received Metal DAO $MTL Private at a 1:1 ratio.\\n\\nMetal DAO $MTL Private implemented the zk-SNARKs privacy protocol, allowing for anonymous transactions while still maintaining the transparency and security of the Metal DAO $MTL blockchain. The airdrop generated significant interest and participation from both the Metal DAO $MTL and Zclassic communities.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the famous MTL airdrops that have occurred throughout history. Airdrops continue to be a popular method for distributing new coins and engaging cryptocurrency communities. Whether it\\'s for marketing purposes, network expansion, or community building, airdrops play a significant role in the evolution of the cryptocurrency landscape.\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested in learning more about MTL airdrops and their impact on the crypto market, you can visit Famous MTL Airdrops Throughout History.\\n\\nBtc airdrops have become a significant phenomenon in the cryptocurrency space, offering a glimpse into the future of token distribution and community engagement. As the crypto landscape evolves, it\\'s crucial to analyze current trends and make informed predictions about the direction in which Btc airdrops are heading.\\n\\nOne of the key trends shaping the future of Btc airdrops is the emphasis on quality over quantity. In the early days of airdrops, projects often distributed tokens widely to attract attention. However, this approach has led to issues such as token dumping and low engagement. Moving forward, we can expect to see a shift towards targeted airdrops that focus on specific communities or demographics.\\n\\nAnother emerging trend is the integration of airdrops with blockchain technology beyond Ethereum. While Ethereum has been the primary platform for airdrops due to its smart contract capabilities, other blockchains like Btc are gaining traction for token distribution. With innovations such as tokenized layers and interoperability protocols, Btc airdrops are becoming more feasible and efficient.\\n\\nFurthermore, the use of testnets for airdrop campaigns is likely to increase in popularity. Testnets provide a risk-free environment for projects to distribute tokens and gather feedback from users before launching on the mainnet. By leveraging testnets, projects can refine their tokenomics and ensure a smoother rollout of their airdrop.\\n\\nWhen considering the future of Btc airdrops, it\\'s essential to address the issue of user participation. Despite the potential rewards, many users are hesitant to participate in airdrops due to concerns about privacy and security. To overcome this barrier, projects need to implement user-friendly strategies that prioritize transparency and security.\\n\\nIn terms of rewards, we may see a shift towards non-monetary incentives such as access to exclusive features or governance rights. These alternative rewards can create long-term value for participants and foster a sense of community ownership over the project.\\n\\nOn the promotional front, social media platforms like Twitter will continue to play a crucial role in spreading awareness about Btc airdrops. However, projects must devise creative strategies to stand out amidst the noise and capture the attention of their target audience.\\n\\nAs we look ahead, the future of Btc airdrops appears promising but challenging. By staying abreast of industry trends and adopting innovative strategies, projects can maximize the potential of airdrops as a tool for decentralized token distribution and community building.\\n\\nFor more insights on Btc airdrops and the latest developments in the crypto space, visit https://url-medium.com/.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Is Seed Paper actually sustainable?',\n",
       "    'body': \"I recently came across a LinkedIn post from a user Shubham Gupta- an IAS officer in which he said that everyone visiting his office will get a card. Nothing strange, right? Well, there is something special in that card. The card was made from seed paper which took my attention and I wanted to know more about it. More interesting was the comment section of post where there was a nice Q/A session between two experts of this technology. You can check it out. Well, here is what my research over Seed paper yields. Before this, a round of applause for Mr. Shubham Gupta for taking this initiative.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, how old is seed paper technology? Many of you would be surprised to know that it was first used in 1400s and hence, the technology is not new. But yes, they were just simply out of sight till early 2000s.It was only in the early 2000s that this technology got importance due to increasing environmental concerns.\\n\\nSeed paper is nothing other than that its name suggests, just a paper embedded with seeds in it. The idea is that these seed papers after use, when discarded can germinate into plants. This idea in itself makes it eco-friendly, as it will -1) degrade easily, its biodegradable 2) Will germinate into plant which leads to increase in green cover.\\n\\nYou might be thinking of how these papers are even manufactured. So, basically during the pulping process, the original raw material from making paper is mixed with seeds and then they are turned into sheets of paper.\\n\\nBut is everything so good? Idea is brilliant but the problem lies in execution. Middle school science teaches us that for seeds to germinate, they need soil, air and water. So, for the idea of seed paper to work, seed papers must be discarded with proper care and should be planted in pots or garden with regular water supply. If anything goes wrong with execution, then no point of this brilliant idea.\\n\\nNext concern about seed paper is its production cost. Due to additional raw material and additional processing, manufacturing cost for seed papers is higher than traditional paper. Hence, seed paper industry faces competition from traditional paper industry. As the costs are high, most people are not willing to pay extra just for an environmental cause. Hence, here comes the need of individual engagement or government interference in the market by subsidizing this industry or any other incentives.\\n\\nEven though, seed papers are gaining popularity due to increasing environmental concerns, but still, they just account for a very less percentage of paper market. Hence, there is a need for growing awareness.\\n\\ncan we even use these seed papers for making notebooks? OR Is any Company currently using seed papers to manufacture notebooks? So, the answer is yes. Seed paper can be used to make cover pages, packaging material and visiting cards and other stuffs. Yes, there are a few companies, mostly based in North America and Europe which are using seed Paper Technology. Some of the Examples are Plantables, EcoEnclose, Botanical Paper Works and Bloomin. If you also want a plant able visiting card for your office, check out these companies.\\n\\nHaving analyzed seed paper market, it's less market share, reasons behind market share, idea of seed paper and manufacturing process of seed papers. Lastly comes the fact that how feasible are these seed papers? What is their Germination rate? So, the germination rate for these seed papers varies and depends on type of seed, quality of seed paper, environmental conditions and handling of seed papers. As a rough estimate, we can assume germination rate of these seed papers to 60-80% according to ChatGPT.\\n\\nConclusion: Yes, Seed papers are sustainable and can prove to be great marvel for environment considering huge scale deforestation. But there are some conditions which need to be followed like proper handling of seed paper and properly planting these papers after use. Apart from this, government need to step in with subsidies and incentives.\",\n",
